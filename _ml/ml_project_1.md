                {'MMM': "I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.Bruce JermelandThank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentations accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events found on Slide 2. First, we will be hosting our Investor Day at your headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota in a few weeks with a welcome reception in the evening of Wednesday, November 14th where we will be highlighting how 3M Science is advancing our priority markets for growth. Along with the formal presentation program, on Thursday November 15, the presentations will discuss our new five-year plan along with our preview of our 2019 outlook. If you plan to attend the event and have not yet responded, please RSVP right away. Second, our Q4 Earnings Conference call will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2019.Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendices of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand out to Mike. Mike?Mike RomanThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining us. In the third quarter 3M delivered a double-digit increase and cash flow and earnings per share along with strong margins despite slower growth. We also continue to execute on business transformation or deploying capital to invest in our future and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, our team posted total sales of $8.2 billion in the quarter.We delivered organic growth of 1% which is on top of 7% growth in last year's third quarter. As you recall from the discussion on our July earnings call, our ERP rollout in the US resulted in revenue shifting between Q2 and the second half of the year. Today, we estimate a pull forward into Q2 was approximately 100 basis points with the vast majority coming out of Q3.Moving on to earnings per share, we posted EPS of $2.58, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our company continues to deliver strong return on invested capital along with premium margins.Companywide we generated margins of 25% with all business groups above 22%. Our team also increased free cash flow by 24% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 114%. This is a testament to the strength of portfolio and business model, and our focus on driving productivity every day. We also continue to invest in R&D and capital to support organic growth while returning cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to 3M shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.Please turn to Slide 5 for look at the performance of our business groups for both the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, three of our five business groups, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics posted organic growth of 2%. Healthcare and Consumer each had areas of strength, but also areas that were softer than expected. Healthcare's growth declined by 1% primarily due to continued weakness in our drug delivery business. Organic growth in Consumer was down 2%. This business group was impacted by channel adjustments between quarters with our major retail customers, though the sellout of our products remains strong. In his comments, Nick will provide more detail on third quarter performance of each business group.Given the shift of sales between quarters due to business transformation, it is also helpful to look at our performance through nine months. Safety and Graphics posted 6% growth followed by 3% growth from both Industrial and Electronics and Energy. Healthcare posted 2% growth with Consumer at 1%. Companywide, we have delivered organic growth of more than 3% year-to-date. I will come back to share our updated guidance after Nick takes us through the details of the quarter. Nick?",
                 'ABT': "With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.And I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott LeinenweberGood morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's medical optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017, as well as current and prior year sales for Alere which was acquired on October 3, 2017.With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.Miles WhiteOkay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.75 along with sales growth of approximately 8% on an organic basis, reflecting well balanced growth across all four of our businesses. I'm particularly pleased with the continued productivity of our new product pipeline and would like to highlight a couple areas where our products are creating and fundamentally shaping markets. I'll start with Structural Heart, where we're the world or the global leader in minimally invasive treatments for mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve. We've recently made several significant advancements in this area. In July, in U.S., we initiated a pivotal trial for Tendyne, our device that is designed to replace damaged mitral heart valves without the need for open heart surgery. We also received U.S. FDA approval for our third generation version of MitraClip, our market leading device for the repair of mitral heart valve. And in September, we announced results of our landmark COAPT trial, which demonstrated that MitraClip improves survival and clinical outcomes for patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the most prevalent form of this condition. We expect to submit this study data to the U.S. FDA in the coming weeks to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. These advancements will further enhance and strengthen our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and will bring new therapies to patients for effective treatment options that are currently limited. Diabetes Care is another area where our technologies are making a big impact, specifically FreeStyle Libre, a revolutionary glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for a 14-day sensor with a shorter one-hour warmup making Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. And in Europe, we obtained CE Mark for our FreeStyle Libre 2 system, our newest generation 14-day system, with optional real-time alarms. In a relatively short period of time, FreeStyle Libre now has more than 1 million users across the globe, a testament to the mass market appeal of this product, which is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments is achieving accelerated growth and strong competitive win rates in Europe where more than 50% of our Alinity instrument placements thus far are coming from share capture. The global rollout of Alinity positions this business for a consistent above market growth for years to come as we capture share and bring the full suite of systems to additional geographies including the U.S. ",
                 'ABBV': "I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are: Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks we'll take your questions.So with that I'll now turn the call over to Rick.Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance, our full-year 2018 guidance, and I'll provide some comments about our expectations for 2019. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, as usual, we will take your questions.We delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with results once again ahead of our expectations. We've driven strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line growth. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.14, representing growth of more than 50% versus last year. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 18.5% was driven by a number of products in our portfolio including HUMIRA with global operational sales growth of nearly 10% and IMBRUVICA which grew more than 40% versus the prior year. HCV was a substantial contributor in the quarter with more than $860 million in sales, and we also saw strong performance from several other products including VENCLEXTA, CREON, DUODOPA and LUPON. Based on the continued strength of our business in the quarter and our progress year to date, we are raising our 2018 earnings guidance for the fourth time this year. We now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.90 to $7.92, reflecting growth of more than 41% at the midpoint. This represents exceptional earnings growth and puts us at the very top of our industry peer group.And while 2018 certainly sets a very high bar for performance, we expect strong earnings growth once again next year. Although it's too early to provide specific growth targets for 2019 as we're still in the midst of our annual planning process, based on our strong underlying business momentum, we are confident in our ability to deliver double digit earnings growth once again in 2019. And importantly, we expect to deliver this level of growth despite a number of factors including direct biosimilar competition, impacting our more than $6 billion international HUMIRA business; a difficult comparison year, particularly in light of the rapid ramp of our HCV business in 2018; and the significant investment we will be making in 2019 to support new product launches including VENCLEXTA, ORILISSA, risankizumab and upadacitinib. Clearly 2019 will be an important year for AbbVie, an opportunity for us to clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive strong earnings growth.In addition to the strong bottom line performance, we also expect to continue to generate significant cash flows. Underscoring the continued confidence in our business, today we're announcing 11.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2019. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend nearly 170%.Also in the quarter, we announced two additional patent license agreements over proposed HUMIRA biosimilar products. These agreements, of which there are now five in total, are yet another example of the strength of our intellectual property, and we remain confident that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023.As we look at our business and evaluate our prospects, just about every aspect of our business is performing at or above our expectations. Our pipeline remains one of the best in the industry and the progress we're making to bring new products to the market will allow us to support our long-term growth expectations. Let me highlight a few examples. We have invested significantly in oncology over the past several years to build a major new growth driver for AbbVie. Today our hematological oncology portfolio is now annualizing above $4 billion and growing at a robust rate, including growth of more than 48% in the third quarter.",
                 'ABMD': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ingrid Goldberg, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Ingrid GoldbergThank you. Good morning and welcome to Abiomed's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. This is Ingrid Goldberg, Director of Investor Relations for Abiomed, and I'm here with Mike Minogue, Abiomed's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Bowen, Former Chief Financial Officer and Consultant to Abiomed.The format for today's call will be as follows: First, Mike Minogue will discuss strategic highlights from the third fiscal quarter and then turn to key operational and strategic objectives. Next, Bob Bowen will provide details on the financial results outlined in today's press release. We will then open the call for your questions.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made on today's call may contained forward-looking statements about the Company's progress relating to financial performance, clinical, regulatory, commercial, litigation and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties are described in the earnings release we issued this morning, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2017, and our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.During today's call adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share and non-GAAP measures will be used to help investors understand the Company's financial performance. These financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in the earnings release and regulatory filing from today which are available in the Investor Section of our website at www. abiomed.com.Thank you for joining us. I'm now pleased to introduce, Abiomed's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Minogue.Michael MinogueThanks, Ingrid. Good morning, everyone. In Q3, Abiomed delivered best ever quarterly results on nearly every metric starting with $154 million in revenue, up 34%. Our robust growth set new records and was driven by U.S. patient utilization for both protected PCI and emergent support, which increased 24% and 43% respectively. In Company history, our top three U.S. Impella utilization months were all in Q3.We also achieved records in Europe aided by strength in Germany which grew 71% year-over-year. Our operational discipline and execution allowed us to achieve best-in-class gross margin of 84% and our best ever operating margin of 29%. We generated an additional $57 million in cash from operations, which brings our cash position to $351 million. We now own both manufacturing and training facilities in Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and maintain no debt as a company.With our solid balance sheet, we are investing in innovation, education, and our patent portfolio. This quarter, we marked a new milestone of 300 patents awarded and an additional 272 patents pending. It is an exciting time as we collaborate with our customers to improve patient outcomes and the standard of care for circulatory support. As a result, the field of heart recovery is growing, and Abiomed is well positioned to capture the $5 billion U.S. market opportunity while planting the seeds for future growth in global markets.For today's call, I will highlight the clinical need and growing awareness of heart recovery with Impella support in the U.S., Germany, and Japan. Starting with the U.S., both the protected PCI and cardiogenic shock indications established new quarterly records. Our Impella adoption increased to a total of 9% of the 121,000 high-risk PCI and 100,000 emergency patients. We continue to have a long runway for growth because of our clinical benefits and FDA approvals.Our focus on training data and time combined with independent physician-led initiatives like CHIP and the National CSI continues to improve awareness and is having an impact on adoption. Last quarter, I spoke about a publication from the Advisory Board, an independent expert healthcare consultant company acquired by United Healthcare. This quarter, the Advisory Board circulated two additional publications referencing Impella.The first publications comes from the Cardiovascular Roundtable Annual Meeting, protected PCI, complex coronary artery disease and cardiogenic shock were highlighted as advanced programs that enable innovative hospitals to differentiate themselves and capture new market opportunities. As a reference TAVR and mitral valve are also on this list.The second publication stressed the significant clinical need for the growing cardiogenic shock population. The report outlined the necessity for aligned patient care recommended tactics for building a cardiogenic shock network and addressed the benefits ranging from improved quality of care to alleviated cost burden. This timely publication piggybacks on the success of this year's TCT physician call to ARMS around improving outcomes in cardiogenic shock and this initiative is underway across United States.",
                 'ACN': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to our host and facilitator as well as our Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Angie Park. Please go ahead.Angie ParkThank you, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I’m Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.With me today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you’ve had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.Let me quickly outline the agenda for today’s call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet for the third quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap up at the end of the call.As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today’s call, we’re talking about revenues before reimbursements or net revenues. Some of the matters we’ll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today’s news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on this call.During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.Pierre NantermeThank you, Angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Accenture had a truly outstanding third quarter. We delivered excellent results from new bookings and revenues to operating margin, EPS and cash flow, and we gained significant market share once again.The durability of our performance demonstrates the relevance of our growth strategy and our ability to continue delivering strong results and returns for our shareholders, while at the same time investing significantly in new growth opportunities to strengthen our position for the long-term.Here are a few highlights from the quarter. We delivered record new bookings of $11.7 billion. We grew revenues 11% in local currency to $10.3 billion, and our growth continues to be well-balanced across the dimensions of our business. We delivered earnings per share of $1.79 on an adjusted basis, an 18% increase.Operating margin was 15.7%, an expansion of 20 basis points on an adjusted basis. We generated very strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, and we returned approximately $1.6 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend.So we’re entering the fourth quarter with excellent momentum in our business, and I feel confident that we are very well-positioned to deliver our business outlook for the year.Now, let me hand over to David, who’ll review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you?David RowlandThank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today’s call. As you heard in Pierre’s comments, we’re extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter, which once again, reflect strong momentum across every dimension of our business.Based on the strength of our third quarter results and the strong confidence and visibility we have in our fourth quarter, we will be increasing key elements of our full-year outlook, which I’ll cover in more detail later in our call. Importantly, both our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full-year reflect very strong execution against all three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value, which I covered in some detail at our Investor Analyst Day in April.So before I get into the details of the quarter, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results. Net revenue increased more than $1.4 billion, reflecting growth of a 11% local currency and representing the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.The strong top line growth exceeded our expectations and reflected strong and balanced growth across all operating groups and geographic areas with several growing double digits. The growth continues to significantly outpace the market, reflecting both our leadership position in "the New" and the durability of our diverse yet highly focused growth model.',
                 'ATVI': "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Activision Blizzard Q3 2018 earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christopher Hickey, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Christopher Hickey - Activision Blizzard, Inc.I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect.A number of factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and those on the slides that are showing. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 8, 2018.We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets and expenses related to acquisitions, including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals, expenses related to debt financings and refinancings, restructuring charges, the associated tax benefits of these excluded items, and the impact of certain significant discrete tax-related items.These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com, for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary.And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc.Thank you all for joining us today.Our results for the third quarter exceeded our prior outlook, as we continue to entertain large audiences, drive deep engagement, and attract significant audience investment across our franchises. Last quarter, on average, 345 million people played our games each month, and our players spent a record 52 minutes per day playing Activision, Blizzard, and King games.Our unique advantage is the ability to create the most compelling interactive and spectator entertainment based on our own franchises combined with our direct digital connection to hundreds of millions of customers in over 190 countries. With these competitive advantages, we continue to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment.Very few companies are able to consistently deliver compelling content to hundreds of millions of customers. Fewer still can provide their audiences with flexible methods of payment for that content. For our hundreds of millions of customers, we now offer content on phones, computers, and video game consoles, and subscription billing, direct digital download billing, virtual item sales, digital advertising, and of course, we still sell our products through tens of thousands of stores around the world.As an example of the breadth of our capabilities, we launched Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 on October 12. Ordinarily, we launch new Call of Duty titles this week in November. But we believe holiday customers, of which there are millions, will benefit from more players in the game earlier.Our engagement to date is better than any Call of Duty content in recent years, and spectator viewing is higher than ever before. As a franchise, Call of Duty has now generated more revenue than the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the box office, and double that of the cumulative box office of Star Wars. We have an exciting future planned for Call of Duty players, including our new Call of Duty professional player opportunities, and lots of exciting new content in 2019 and beyond.We remain focused on the key growth drivers of our business that we believe present meaningful revenue and engagement upside, including live operations, mobile, and investment in new and growing franchise engagement models. We're pleased with our early momentum in areas like our advertising initiatives, which continue to exceed our plans, as revenues grew almost 50% sequentially.",

Lisa?Lisa T. Su - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter. We continued to build momentum for our new products as strong sales of our Ryzen and EPYC processors offset soft GPU channel sales, and drove our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth, increased profitability and margin expansion.Third quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago. Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter CG segment revenue increased 12% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in both client processor and OEM GPU sales that offset a larger-than-expected decline in channel GPU sales.Ryzen processor sales increased to more than 70% of our total client revenue in the quarter. We delivered our highest processor unit shipment in nearly four years, and believe we gained desktop and notebook client processor unit share in the quarter, driven by growth with both OEMs and in the channel. In desktop, we had strong demand for our higher end Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen Threadripper processors, helping to drive a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequential improvement in client processor ASP.We expanded our desktop offerings in the quarter, bringing our Zen processor core and Vega Graphics to the entry level part of the market with the Athlon APU, and launching our flagship 32-core Threadripper 2 processor. With these new introductions, we now have a top to bottom lineup of client processors, based on our high-performance Zen architecture.In notebooks, Ryzen mobile processor unit shipments doubled sequentially for the second straight quarter as OEMs ramped production of their latest AMD-based notebooks. 54 of the 60 Ryzen processor based notebooks planned for 2008 (sic) [2018] (04:45) have launched with the final notebooks expected to go on sale this quarter. Based on the success of first-generation Ryzen mobile notebooks, the expanded breadth of our customer engagements and our design win momentum, we are on track for an even larger assortment of AMD-powered notebooks in 2019.In graphics, the year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales, partially offset by improved OEM and datacenter GPU sales. Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected, based on excess channel inventory levels, caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand that was so strong earlier in the year. OEM GPU sales in the third quarter increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as new design wins began to ramp, including first shipments of our mobile Vega GPUs to support new premium notebooks launching this quarter.",
                 'AAP': 'Elisabeth EislebenGood morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. I’m joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Bob Cushing, our Executive Vice President of Professional; and Mike Broderick, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising and Store Operations Support. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.Before we begin, please be advised that our comments today may include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are described in a Risk Factors section in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we maintain no duty to update forward-looking statements made.Additionally, our comments today include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Please refer to our quarterly press release and accompanying financial statements issued today for additional detail regarding the forward-looking statements and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures referenced in today’s call. The content of this call will be governed by the information contained in our earnings release and related financial statements.Now, let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.Tom GrecoThanks, Elizabeth, and good morning. First, I’d like to thank the entire Advance team and our network of Carquest Independent for a strong quarter, characterized by progress on virtually every financial and marketplace metric. It’s because of their dedication and unrelenting focus on the customer that we were able to deliver our strongest comparable sales growth in nearly eight years, which in turn led to improved market share performance. It’s clear that our transformation actions are beginning to take hold, driving meaningful improvements in execution, enabling us to earn more business with our valued customers.In the third quarter, net sales increased by 4.3% to $2.3 billion and comp sales were up 4.6%. Our adjusted operating income margin of 8.5% increased 62 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. And our adjusted earnings per share increased 32.2% to $1.89.Year-to-date, our free cash flow was $576 million, an increase of $336 million year-over-year, as we continue to drive disciplined cash management practices throughout the organization. Our sales performance in the quarter is a testament to the hard work of our entire team, truly living our cultural belief and executing on our mission, Passion for Customers, Passion for Yes!Not only did we deliver the strongest comparable sales growth since 2010, our absolute growth in the quarter was above the industry average, driven by increased units per transaction and average ticket value. Importantly, we strengthened our customer value proposition and delivered balanced, consistent growth throughout Q3 in both our DIY omni-channel and professional businesses.From a geographic perspective, we saw improvement across all 12 regions. Our Southeast, Midwest, Appalachia, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions led the way. From a category perspective, we saw increased sales across nearly every category with the strongest growth in brakes, batteries, and optics, where we delivered high single-digit growth. Without a doubt, we’re seeing better coordination and planning across our merchandising, marketing and field operations teams, which is also contributing to our momentum.Finally, we’re leveraging supplier partnerships and improved analytical capabilities to ensure we have the right inventory, in the right locations, at the right time. This is a work-in-progress and we still have significant opportunity, but we believe that the improvements made so far are helping our improved execution.Going a little deeper in Professional, we saw improved performance across every AAP banner in the U.S., including Advance, Worldpac, Autopart International and importantly both Carquest Corporate and Independent stores. Our customers want choices, and thanks to cross-banner visibility, we’re doing a much better job of leveraging AAP’s industry leading assortment of brands to ensure our pro customers have the options they desire to meet the needs of their customers.Through continued focus on our customer value proposition and direct feedback from our professional customers, we recently launched myadvance.com. This is an interactive, easy to use, mobile friendly platform where we’ve combined multiple online tools and capabilities into one place, including our Advance Pro online ordering platform.On myadvance.com, professional customers can access industry-leading cross-banner assortment as well as best-in-class shop services and solutions such as an expert corner featuring content rich training and shop business solution advice from automotive aftermarket industry leaders. These initiatives are driving incremental growth for our Professional business.We’re equally excited about the growth within our DIY omni-channel business. In Q3, we saw increases in both DIY retail and DIY online, marking the second consecutive quarter with sales growth in both. We launched our new advertising campaign, Think Ahead. Think Advance, and it’s off to a great start. We continue to invest in e-commerce, where enhancements we made to our website improved the customer experience, including reduced page load times and additional personalization modules.In addition, well today, the majority of our online orders are, buy online pickup in store, we’ve made progress on our ship to home capabilities. Overall, our investments drove strong double-digit revenue growth in Q3. While we are pleased that our improving execution is driving topline strength, we remain focused on controlling expenses across the organization. I was delighted with our store team’s ability to once again, leverage additional customer service hours through increased sales in the third quarter.In addition, we’re seeing a noticeable shift in culture as safety has become a critical focus throughout Advance. Importantly, our progress on safety initiatives enabled a reduction in liability and vehicle claims in the quarter and we expect to see further benefits as a result of our safety initiatives. Our investment in this critical area has paid off quickly and I’m confident we’re developing a true safety culture with heightened attention on team member safety throughout Advance.',
                 'AES': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Ahmed PashaThank you, Brendon. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2018 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.Joining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés. Andrés.Andrés GluskiGood morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 financial review call. We had a strong quarter demonstrated by solid financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We continue to improve the returns from our existing portfolio and position AES for long-term sustainable growth.Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.35 puts us at $0.88 for the first nine months of 2018 which is 35% higher than the $0.65 we earned in the same period last year. We remain on-track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer term expectations. Tom will discuss our results in more detail after I provide a review of our strategic accomplishments. I will structure my remarks today around four overall themes; first, optimizing our returns; second, our growing backlog of renewable projects; third, advancing our LNG strategy; and finally, deploying new technologies. I have discussed these themes in the past, and on this call I will provide concrete examples of how we're delivering on each in support of our overall strategy.Beginning on Slide 4 with optimizing our returns. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while reducing our overall risk and carbon footprint. As can be seen on the slide, our renewable investments are projected to produce low-to-high teen IRRs across all markets assuming conservative terminal values. Specifically, as you may recall, we bought sPower in 2017 at a high single-digit return; since then we have taken steps to enhance that return including refinancings and operational improvements. This morning we announced that we have agreed to sell 24% of sPower's operating portfolio to Ullico. As a result of all of these actions we have improved our expected return on sPower's operating portfolio to around 13%, and we will use the proceeds to help fund new solar and wind projects in the U.S.Now turning to our backlog of renewable projects beginning on Slide 5. Our robust pipeline continues to increase driven by our focus on select markets where we can take advantage of our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses. So far this year we have signed 1.9 gigawatts of long-term PPAs for renewable projects or 93% of our internal projection of 2 gigawatts for full year 2018. We are on pace to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs annually for 2019 and 2020. We expect this capacity to be split 50-50 between the U.S. and internationally, and similarly, between solar and wind. By the end of 2020 we expect to have signed 7.5 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs all of which will be online by 2022. To complement our strategy to invest in attractive renewable projects and expand our environmental, social and governance related disclosures; next week we will be releasing a climate scenario report that complies with the guidelines of the task force on climate related financial disclosures and includes updated carbon intensity reduction targets that reflect our renewable growth.Now onto Slide 6 and how we are capitalizing on our existing footprint. As you may recall, on our last call we introduced our green blend and extend strategy. With this win-win strategy we leverage our existing platforms, contracts and relationships to negotiate new long-term PPAs with higher returns than we would otherwise get through a bidding process. We see potential opportunities to execute on this strategy across many of our markets including Chile, Mexico and United States. In the near-term we see an addressable universe of 7 gigawatts across our portfolio which could substantially increase as other markets capitalize on the economic benefits of renewables.Turning to Slide 7; we have signed two green blend and extend contracts for a total of 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. The contract in Chile was the first of it's kind; we signed an 18-year contract with an existing customer for 1,100 gigawatt hours of annual delivery [ph] which is equivalent to 270 megawatts of renewable capacity. This will lengthen AES Gener's average contract life to 11 years, replace 5% of AES Gener's total load, and 40% of the thermal PPAs expiring in 2022. We are also implementing a similar contract in Mexico with our off-taker Penoles. To help Penoles gradually replace pet-coke with greener, efficient renewable energy, we negotiated a 25-year PPA to build the 306 megawatt Mesa La Paz wind project leveraging our strong existing customer relationship and our global renewables capabilities. This will increase our average contract life with Penoles from 8 years to 17 years.",
                 'AMG': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Parker, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.Jeffrey ParkerThank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2018.In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the Company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the Company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call and an investor presentation. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.With us on the line to discuss the Company's results for the quarter are Nate Dalton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.With that, I'll turn the call over to Nate.Nate DaltonThanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Against the challenging industry backdrop, AMG generated solid results in the third quarter of 2018, including positive net client cash flows of approximately $1 billion and economic earnings per share of $3.45. Our results reflect the diversity of our global business and our strategic position in attractive, return-oriented products, where we continue to see significant client demand for our affiliate strategies and the distinctive investment return streams they create.In terms of third quarter flow, we saw continued strong demand for alternatives, which included another quarter of very significant illiquid product fundraising from institutional clients, partially offset by softness in liquid alternatives in the retail channel, where investors tend to be more sensitive to short-term performance. The ongoing strength of our alternative products was partially offset by net outflows from equity strategies, driven primarily by emerging markets products and U.S. equity retail outflows.At the highest level, we were pleased with our positive organic growth in the third quarter, despite industry headwinds. We benefited from having built a diverse global business and we're pleased to see a very broad array of product types. Affiliates and geographies contributed significantly to our flow composition, as we saw strong sales across Baring Asia, BlueMountain, Capula, EIG, Pantheon, and PFM within our alternative category. [Indiscernible] Frontier and Harding Loevner were notable contributors within our equities category.Now, looking ahead, I want to address the current market environment and how we have built and continue to position our business. Obviously, it's been a volatile period. Global and U.S. equity markets have declined roughly 10% month to date as of Friday. And frankly that understates some of the underlying volatility we've been seeing. Anecdotal evidence points to some de-risking in this environment and you can see that reflected in this month's retail flow data.In the short run, this obviously creates challenges in various segments of the asset management industry. But in terms of AMG, we've been evolving the business in anticipation of more volatile and fundamentals-driven market, with the highest quality active managers proving their worth. Volatile markets underscore the need for investors to diversify their equity and fixed income exposure, especially when markets are at elevated levels. Finally, within both traditional and alternative categories, volatile markets create environment with the best active managers, like our affiliates, who can significantly outperform their benchmarks in simple passive products.Looking ahead, I would focus on three aspects of our business and strategic position. One, the diversity of the business we've built over the years. Two, the opportunities for the best active managers to outperform in this environment. And three, the quality of our affiliates and the distinctive return streams they produce.First, on the diversity of our business. Over the last decade, we have deliberately doubled the proportion of our business in alternatives from approximately 20% in the beginning of 2008 to approximately 40% of assets under management today, spread across a very diverse set of high quality alternative products, while increasing our exposure to growing parts of client portfolios at the highly active alpha end of the barbell.This evolution has come from both investments in new affiliates, as well as product innovation and development by us and our affiliates. Our alternatives business now has approximately $320 billion in assets under management, making AMG one of the largest alternative managers with one of the broadest and most diverse ranges of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies, managed by leading investors, including AQR, Baring Asia, BlueMountain, Capula, EIG, First Quadrant, Pantheon, PFM, Systematica, ValueAct and Winton.In addition, our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies should increase the stability and resilience of our business across market cycles, while most importantly, proving attractive to clients, so increasing the long-term organic growth potential of our business.",
                 'AFL': "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Young, Vice President of Aflac Investor & Rating Agency Relations.David Young - Aflac, Inc.Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter call. This morning, we will be hearing remarks from Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, about the quarter as well as our operations in Japan and the United States. Then, Fred Crawford, Executive Vice President and CFO of Aflac Incorporated, will follow with more details about our financial results, outlook and capital management. We will then open our call to questions.Joining us this morning during the Q&A portion are members of our executive management team in the U.S., Teresa White, President of Aflac U.S.; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer; Rich Williams, Chief Distribution Officer; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; and Max Brodén, Treasurer.We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan, Charles Lake, President of Aflac International and Chairman, Representative Director; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and Principal Financial Officer; and Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing.Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature.Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. The earnings release is available on the Investors page of Aflac's website at investors.aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures.I'll now hand the call over to Dan.Daniel P. Amos - Aflac, Inc.Thank you, Dave, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that the third quarter 2018 concluded a great nine months for Aflac and well positioned us to achieve the goals we set for the year. As you saw from the earnings release yesterday, I am pleased that we expect to come in at the high end of the upwardly revised 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. Fred will provide more details in his comments shortly.Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor, generated strong financial results. In yen terms, Aflac Japan's pre-tax profit margin was ahead of expectations both for the quarter and for the first nine months.Aflac Japan's third sector sales results of a 2.6% decrease was consistent with our expectations. This reflects sales growth in our new cancer insurance and a decline in our medical insurance sales. As medical sales came-off a strong year bolstered by refresher core products, our distribution turned its focus this year on our new cancer product as they tend to do when a new core product is introduced. We expect similar results in the fourth quarter and continue to anticipate third sector new sales growth for the year to be in the low-single-digit.As I've said many times, our focus is on defending and growing our leading third sector franchise. We are indifferent as to the mix of medical and cancer sales as long as we are satisfying the needs of the consumer and our distribution partners. Regarding distribution, we had meaningful production across all channels. Traditional agencies have been and remain vital to our success.Our Alliance partners has also had significant contribution to our sales results, with such an extensive distribution network, including Japan Post 20,000-plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance, we are solidifying our goal to be where people want to buy insurance.Our focus remains on remaining on maintaining our leadership position in the sale of third sector products that are less interest rate-sensitive and have strong and stable margins. We will continue to refine our existing product portfolio and introduce innovative new third sector products to maintain our market leadership.Turning to Aflac U.S., we are pleased with our financial performance. The pre-tax profit margins exceeded our expectations both for the quarter and for the first nine months. Our third quarter new annualized premium sales, together with our sales outlook, keep us on track to achieve the lower end of our anticipated 2018 new annualized premium sales growth of the 3% to 5% increase.As you think about U.S. sales, keep in mind that Aflac is different from our peers and that the majority of our sales come from independent sales agents. We are fortunate to have such a strong independent field force which is truly unique within our industry. These career sales agents are best positioned within the industry to reach and therefore succeed with smaller employers and groups with fewer than 100 employees.Aflac's independent career agents have been the driving force behind Aflac's ability to dominate the smaller case market. And I continue to believe this market is ours to grow. We continue to expect higher growth in broker sales. Our team of broker sales professionals has made great strides in successfully strengthening Aflac's relationship within the large broker community.",
                 'A': "It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over Ms. Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President Investor Relations.

Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Before I discuss the Q3 financial highlights and our updated outlook I'm pleased to have Bob McMahon join the call. Bob is an excellent choice for Agilent’s next CFO and a very capable successor to Didier. Bob brings a strong track record of leadership to our team. Many of you already know Bob from his previous role of CFO of Hologics. He officially assumes the CFO role beginning September 1.As Didier hands off the baton, he will serve as adviser capacity until his retirement at the end of October. Bob and Didier working together to ensure a smooth transition. I first met Bob when in Palo Alto where we shared our perspective on business and company culture. We had an important conversation about values and the importance of business. I knew immediately that Bob would be a great fit for the Agilent culture and of course his management style and business acumen are a perfect match for our approach to trading shareholder value. Bob has joined Agilent in an exciting time. I'm confident he'll help us lead the next phase of Agilent growth.While I'm very excited to have Bob join the Agilent team I will greatly miss Didier's partnership and counsel. He has played a key role in the transformation of the company and our excellent business results. It's important for the CEO to have a very capable CFO. I couldn't have asked for a better partner. So thank you Didier. You will be missed by me and our Agilent team.Now, let me turn to our Q3 financial performance. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter with both growth and earnings exceeding our expectations. Our core revenue grew 6% and is above the high-end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 is $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance despite currency headwinds since our last guide. This is a 14% increase from a year-ago. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.6%, which is an increase of 110 basis points from a year-ago. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of improving our core operating margins.Let's take a closer look at our results by our end-markets. We continue our strong Pharma performance with 8% core growth. This is against a tough compare as we grew 10% in Q3 '17. We see strength across all our business groups with particularly strong performance in mass spectrometry, Cell Analysis, CrossLabs consumables and services and genomics. Growth remains robust in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments.Our Chemical and Energy market revenue grew 12%. We are quite pleased with this strong growth. Again, against a difficult prior-year compare of 10%. Ongoing market investment remains positive. This is in spite of tariff rhetoric and retaliatory policies you've been hearing in the news. From a product perspective strength in spectroscopy, GC, CrossLabs consumables and services is driving this result. Geographically strong gains in China and Europe are leading the overall global growth.Revenue grew 3% in academia and government inline with expectations, strong performance from Cell Analysis, molecular spectroscopy, ICP/MS and CrossLabs consumers and services are driving the results. China and the rest of Asia are delivering double-digit growth in this end-market.",
                 'APD': "Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.Thank you, Vicky. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products third quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions.Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We certainly do appreciate your interest in Air Products. The talented, committed, and motivated team at Air Products delivered another excellent set of safety and financial results. Our record adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 is up 18% versus last year. This is the 17th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth and the fifth consecutive quarter we have delivered year-on-year EPS growth of more than 15%. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a record quarterly dividend margin of over 36%.We continue to generate significant cash, which supports our robust dividend policy. And we do have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, which gives us the ability to commit a significant amount of capital to grow Air Products in the coming years. And most important, we have a great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented, and committed people at Air Products, who have stayed focused on working hard every day to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders.Now, please turn to slide number 3. We continue to improve our safety results with a reduction of 67% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 52% in our recordable injury rate. These results can only happen when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are committed to safety and continuous improvement.On slide number 4, you can see our goal for the company, to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. And I want to emphasize that the most diverse in our goal refers to our people. We value a diverse workforce.Now, please turn to slide number 5. You can see our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times over the last four years. But it is worth repeating because we continue to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation, and an empowered and decentralized organization.Now, please turn to slide number 6. It was almost four years ago that I shared our original Five-Point Plan: we have successfully focused on Air Products' core industrial gases business; we have restructured the organization; changed the culture; controlled capital and costs; and aligned our rewards. We have done what we promised to do.Now, please turn to the slide number 7. Our journey is never complete, and it's time to evolve our Five-Point Plan to guide us over the coming years. Let me explain each of the points on this slide one at a time. First, from the left side, in terms of sustaining our lead, we will keep our focus on safety. We have done well, but even one injury is too many. Accidents don't happen by themselves. Every incident or accident is preventable. We want to be the best-in-class in everything we do. We need to be the best-in-class operationally, for example, to make sure our plants are running all the time. The same thing with our human resource processes, financial processes, safety processes. Everything that we do, we should aim to, and we will be, the very best in the industry. And productivity, we obviously need to continue to focus on productivity to maintain our margins.Second, in terms of deployment of capital, as you have heard me say before, we believe that we have at least $15 billion of capital to commit over the next five years. This includes cash and debt capacity available today and the investable cash flow we expect to generate in the next five years. I remain very confident – and I like to repeat this – I remain very confident that we will be able to commit the full $15 billion to very high-quality industrial gas projects over the next five years.",
                 'AKAM': "I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.Tom BarthThank you, Gigi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's view on October 29, 2018. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.Thomson LeightonThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai delivered excellent results in the third quarter. Revenue was $670 million, up 7% over Q3 of last year and up 8% in constant currency, with continued very strong performance for our security products and continued improvement in our Media and Carrier Division. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.94 per diluted share, up 47% year-over-year. This very strong result was driven by our solid revenue growth, the impact of cost reductions made over the past year and a lower tax rate.EBITDA margins in Q3 improved to 41%, and non-GAAP operating margins improved to 27%. This mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improving margins and we expect further improvements by the end of the year. Looking further ahead, we are now confident that we can achieve non-GAAP operating margins of 30% in 2020, while continuing to invest in innovation and new products to drive our future growth.In Q3, our security portfolio was again the fastest growing part of our business, with revenue of $169 million, up 39% over Q3 of last year in constant currency. Our security business accounted for 25% of our total Q3 revenue and exited the quarter at a run rate of nearly $700 million per year, making Akamai one of the world's largest cloud security providers.Our security products received accolades from two leading analyst firms last month. Gartner named Akamai as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Web application firewalls for the second year in a row. And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in its new wave for Bot Management, giving Akamai’s our highest rating possible for attack response, threat research, reporting and analysis, roadmap and market approach.In a world where lots of claims are made by competing companies, it's gratifying to receive this level of recognition from the world's leading industry analyst firms. There are several reasons why Akamai is a leader in Cybersecurity. Our track record of innovation and emphasis on R&D combined with smart and accretive acquisitions. Our edge platforms enormous capacity and close proximity to users and devices, the insights in real-time data we gained from protecting so many of the world's leading enterprises, and our team of experts who provide exceptional customer service and support.Many of our customers have told us that they simply have too much at stake to risk their business on anything less. Most of our security revenue today is based on protecting public-facing websites and applications from denial of service and application-layer attacks. We've also been developing novel products to protect internal enterprise applications. And I am very pleased to report that these new products have been gaining traction.Bookings in Q3 for our Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Protector services were up 30% over Q2 and up more than fourfold over Q3 of last year. Our new enterprise security customers include leading companies such as one of the largest banks in the UK, a $10 billion travel company, a $4 billion luxury fashion brand, two of the world's leading consulting firms and a $30 billion media company.We believe that our new enterprise security offerings are gaining traction because they provide the core capabilities needed for a zero-trust security architecture. It's called zero-trust because enterprises can no longer assume that any device or employee on their internal network is trustworthy, as because employees sometimes click on the wrong link and accidentally import malware, which can then lead to a very costly data breach.As a result, we've seen growing interest in new architectures that protect internal applications by granting access at the application layer instead of the network layer. This approach avoids exposing corporate networks through a VPN and eliminates the need to manage complex network firewall rules.",
                 'ALK': "I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.Thanks, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue results and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flows. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $217 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $237 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, ahead of the First Call consensus.As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad.Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are rapidly approaching the two-year mark since our merger closed and while there's still a lot of work ahead of us, we are extremely happy about the pace of progress and we remain confident in our future. We've now completed roughly 90% of the integration milestones and have done so at a pace that is equal to or more rapid than virtually any other merger in the industry.The performance of our core business remains strong and our brand and product are gaining increasing traction in California. As our network investments mature and the merger synergies accelerate, we're doubling down on the disciplines of productivity, teamwork and cost control, disciplines that have been the source of our competitive advantage for many years now.In the third quarter, our financial performance started to turn the corner with our employees delivering unit revenues and unit costs that were both better than plan. We were especially encouraged to see RASM stabilize in the face of multiple headwinds. We expect RASM to inflect positive in the fourth quarter as we begin the steady climb toward the higher margins and higher returns that we believe are achievable with our combined network.As we've discussed, we're not satisfied with our current financial returns. Fuel prices continue to rise and we need to do more to recover these higher costs. One way we've responded is by raising bag fees for the first time in five years, bringing our fees into line with those that are now prevalent in the marketplace. We announced these changes last week and Andrew will discuss them further in just a moment.Stepping back a bit, we see an industry environment that has not yet adequately adjusted to higher fuel prices. We've slowed our growth in 2019, as market dynamics simply don't argue for adding much new capacity. That said, we are comfortable with our current growth and we're very comfortable with our new network footprint.We have a solid plan in place to leverage the many factors within our control and to drive unit revenues and margins higher going forward. We're making it even more granular as we go through the budget process. We're confident that we're on a path to significantly improve our profitability and our free cash flow in both 2019 and 2020.Before I discuss future plans, I would like to highlight a few of our team's accomplishments in the third quarter. First, we were proud to win Best U.S. Airline from both Condé Nast Traveler and KAYAK. The Condé Nast recognition is especially meaningful, as it continued a tradition. Virgin America had won this award for the past 10 years and now our folks have extended the streak to 11.",
                 'ALB': "David Ryan - Albemarle Corp.Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted to our website under the Investors Section at www.albemarle.com. Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium.As a reminder, some of the statements made during the conference call about our outlook, expected company performance, production volumes and commitments, as well as lithium demand may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.Please also note that some of our comments today refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.Now, I will turn the call over to Luke.Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We apologize for the little snafu at the very beginning. Apparently, you could hear us, but we couldn't hear the operator; so, we apologize and hope we got that fixed.Turning to the third quarter, in the third quarter, our revenue grew $50 million, or 7%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by $36 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2017 excluding divested businesses. This marks our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.During the third quarter, Bromine Specialties and Catalysts both reported pro forma adjusted EBITDA growth over last year. In Lithium, third quarter pricing increased year-on-year as expected; however, unexpected outages at three of our manufacturing sites during the quarter caused volume shortfalls, which resulted in our not being able to meet the sales commitments in the quarter. These issues were one-time in nature and have been addressed. All of our Lithium facilities are now running at forecasted production rates.In addition, our Lithium capital projects remain on track. We completed the tie-ins at La Negra II and expect to operate that unit at full rates in 2019. La Negra III and IV, which is a 40,000 met ton carbonate expansion, is progressing as planned towards commissioning during 2020. Earlier this year, we commissioned an expansion of our evaporation system in the Salar de Atacama, enlarging our evaporation pond capacity by 60%. Additional ponds of more than 450 acres are on schedule for completion in early 2019. This expanded pond system will provide sufficient feedstock for all of our carbonate production facilities in Chile.In China, we have completed all pre-commissioning activities at Xinyu II and are now transitioning that unit over to operations. We have begun startup activities and we'll be in this phase over the next few months. We expect significant hydroxide volumes from this unit in 2019. With respect to the Kemerton Lithium Hydroxide facility, we are on track to obtain all necessary approvals to begin earthwork at the site in December.Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $130 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.31, an increase of about $0.31 per share compared to third quarter 2017, or 31% growth excluding divested businesses and other one-time items. Our businesses and lower corporate expenses delivered about $0.31 per share of growth with strong performance in Bromine Specialties and Catalysts. Our share repurchase program contributed about $0.04 during the quarter. Those gains were partially offset by a net cost increase in other areas, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate and unfavorable foreign exchange compared to the third quarter 2017.Let me talk about each of the businesses. Lithium reported third quarter net sales of $271 million and adjusted EBITDA of $114 million, each up about 1% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42%. Average prices were up 6% versus the third quarter 2017 with battery grade salts providing most of that improvement. The gains were mostly offset by the volume impact from the unexpected plant outages. Hydroxide volumes and cost were unfavorable due to a one-week shutdown in Kings Mountain as a result of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina.",
                 'ARE': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Ms. Schwartz, please go ahead.Paula SchwartzThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.Joel MarcusThank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the third quarter call for Alexandria. And with me today are Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga, Dan Ryan. The third quarter was an outstanding quarter by almost every financial and operating metric and particularly core operating metrics that were really stellar and Dean will talk more about that.My congratulations to our entire Alexandria family and for each person’s day-to-day, day in and day out operational excellence, which is what really makes it all happen. And also congratulations to the world-class accounting and finance team on their many years of hard work, resulting in our recent credit upgrade from Moody's, something very important.And Moody’s does focus on tenant quality and at Alexandria, it's one of our strongest characteristics of the Company. As you know from the earnings release, 52% of our annual rental revenue is from investment grade or large cap public companies. We are very proud that 79%, almost 80% of that revenue is from Class A assets in AAA locations, and about 60% of that is focused in Cambridge in San Francisco. Average lease term is about 8.6 years and 12.3 for top 20 tenants. So really a very strong and stellar core to the tenant base.I want to just make a couple of comments on the industry for the quarter. Venture funding in life science continued at very strong pace over $7 billion in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of over $5 billion invested. And this is really a record breaking trend driven by increase in deal size and well established venture firms raising larger funds and deploying capital at a faster pace.Something else that I think we are very fortunate, we had our 47th new drug approved on October 24, this year and the FDA has surpassed last year's 46th drug approval count and could be on pace to beat the all time record of 53 set in 1996. Strong bipartisan support resulted in legislation enacted to increase the National Institutes of Health. Overall funding, $2 billion to approximately $39.1 billion and we are very fortunate about that. I think that is one of the critical competitive advantages of the United States in the world of biomedical research.We did have very strong legislation, bipartisan legislation passed to address the opioid crisis signed in a law by the President, in the recent past. And certainly the opioid crisis has been a scourge resulting in the death of over 64,000 people last year greater than those died in the entire Vietnam War, which is actually hard to fathom. And so all of us in the industry and particularly ourselves are focused on specific things we can do to advance that project forward and we'll give you more details on that in coming quarters.Biotech IPO activity has been the strongest since 2014, approaching 50 certainly over the next couple of weeks and raising almost $5 billion during the first nine months. The NASDAQ biotech index has been down a bit recently due to the volatility this month with the markets as all of you know and we've seen certainly a flight of value and big cap safety.And I think with that, I'm going to turn it over to Steve to comment on a number of operational aspects, then Peter and then back.Stephen RichardsonGreat. Thank you, Joel. Steve Richardson here. This afternoon I'll highlight the continued strong demand for Alexandria’s highly differentiated Class A science and technology campuses and the country's leading innovation clusters.Building on what Joel had mentioned about the life science capital markets, we did have 17 IPOs this quarter and this is just part of an overall strong demand context, really driving stellar leasing and financial results with increases this quarter of 16.9% in cash and 35.4% in GAAP, the highest in 10 years.Drilling down to Alexandria’s cluster markets, it's important to know that Alexandria has been a first mover in each of these markets, and as such as a dominant position with the highest quality campuses immediately proximate to the country's leading life science research institutions.",
                 'ALXN': "Good morning, and welcome to the Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Altschuller. [Technical Difficulty] (00:17-00:28)Susan Altschuller - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional details. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you.Ludwig?Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Thank you, Susan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We continue to build on our momentum, advancing our mission of bringing hope to patients and families affected by rare diseases. We had an excellent third quarter with a number of significant achievements to highlight.Yesterday marked the anniversary of the FDA approval of Soliris for patients with MG. One year later, I'm very proud to say that we have delivered on our ambition of making MG the best Soliris launch yet.Last month, we reported remarkable topline results from our Phase 3 PREVENT study of Soliris in NMOSD. We're moving quickly to prepare global regulatory submissions, which can make Soliris the first approved therapy for patients with this devastating disease.Also last month, we announced an agreement to acquire Syntimmune and with its SYNT001, an innovative FcRn-targeted asset that holds great promise for treating IgG-mediated diseases. And once again, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth.Moving to slide six, we've continued to execute on our five key objectives throughout the year. We have made notable progress in addition to the achievements I've just mentioned. We continue to grow the in-line business with our Complement and Metabolic portfolios, delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 26% in the quarter.MG remains a significant growth driver. And at the end of September, 560 MG patients were on therapy in the U.S.The PNH regulatory submissions for Ultomiris, formerly referred to as ALXN1210, have been accepted in the U.S., EU and Japan, and we're actively preparing for anticipated launches.I'm very pleased with the significant progress we've made in building our pipeline this year with Syntimmune, Wilson Therapeutics, Complement Pharma, and most recently, Dicerna. Our pipeline today is far more robust and diverse.Again, I will highlight the groundbreaking results from our Phase 3 study of Soliris in NMOSD, which showed a 94.2% reduction in the risk of adjudicated relapse and an adjudicated annualized relapse rate of 0.02.Finally, given our strong financial performance, we have increased our guidance. We have accomplished a lot in the first three quarters of this year: executing on our base business, successfully launching in MG, preparing for Ultomiris launches, and rebuilding our pipeline for long-term value creation, all while maintaining a focus on transforming the lives of patients with rare diseases.With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss the third quarter financial results and to provide details on our guidance. Paul?Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Thanks, Ludwig. I'm pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter. Starting with slide 8, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of 20% year-over-year, driven by continued performance of Soliris and Metabolic portfolios. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 54% in the third quarter, an expansion of 916 basis points. This was well above our prior forecast, driven by topline leverage, timing of program spend and lower workforce costs.We're anticipating a lower operating margin in the fourth quarter of the year due to an expanding pipeline and sales and marketing investment to support our growth opportunities. I'll provide further details. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 40%, driven by topline performance and strong operating expense control.",
                 'ALGN': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, VP of Corporate and Investor Communications.Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are set forth in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may vary significantly and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our third quarter conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? .Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions.I'm pleased to report third quarter results with revenue and earnings above our outlook, driven by higher-than-expected Invisalign volume, offset somewhat by lower ASPs and foreign exchange. We also had another record quarter for iTero scanner business. Q3 Invisalign volume increased 5.5% sequentially and up 35.3% year-over-year, reflecting strength across regions and customer channels as well as strong growth from both teen and adult patients.From a product perspective, we saw strength across the Invisalign portfolio, with growth from both the comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, reflecting acceleration in the non-comprehensive category related to expansion of our product portfolio, as well as new sales programs and promotions intended to increase adoption and utilization. We also saw continued strength from international regions, especially Asia-Pacific, which is our second largest region after the Americas in Q3.Finally, during Q3, we trained another record 4,930 doctors, driven by APAC and Latin America, including Invisalign Go doctors, which represent continued expansion of our customer base, especially GP dentists. And Invisalign utilization increased overall to 6.1 cases per doctor, including another record for NA orthodontists.Overall, while I'm pleased with the strong volume growth that we achieved this quarter, there were a couple of unexpected factors that impacted our results. In Q3, Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially due to a combination of promotional programs, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases across all regions. John will provide more details on this in his commentary.Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results and let's start with the results of our America region. For the Americas, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.1% sequentially and 29.1% year-over-year, reflecting better-than-expected volume in both our orthodontist and GP dentist channels, driven by strong teenage case volume from orthodontists and adult patient growth across both customer channels.For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by orthos, with another record quarter for North American ortho utilization at 17.4 cases per doctor. Q3 Invisalign utilization for North American GP dentists was up year-over-year at 3.5 cases per doctor, reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base. We also saw strong volume growth from the dental service organizations or DSOs channel, which increased over 40% year-over-year in Q3.In Q3, we trained over 2,000 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 560 were in Latin America alone, primarily Brazil. As the world's second largest market for cosmetic procedures, Brazil is estimated to have more than 1 million new orthodontic case starts each year. In September, we hosted a grand opening event at our new office in São Paulo, Brazil with local doctors to thank them for their ongoing support in helping to build the clear aligner market in Brazil through Invisalign practices.We also hosted the grand opening of our newest facilities in Costa Rica located at San Antonio business center, with plans to open another multimillion-dollar facility located at La Lima later this year. The new facilities will eventually house all of our Costa Rica employees, provide space to accommodate our long-term growth.For international doctors, Q3 was another good quarter with Invisalign case volumes up 6.2% sequentially, reflecting a very strong quarter for APAC, offset by EMEA's seasonality, especially in Southern Europe markets which typically have extended summer holidays. Year-over-year volume growth of 45.6% for international reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base.",
                 'ALLE': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Mike Wagnes - Allegion PlcThank you, Andrew.

We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.Please go to slide number 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave.David D. Petratis - Allegion PlcThanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered another strong quarter in Q3 and I'm pleased with our operational performance, which has positioned us well to deliver a solid 2018. Allegion saw a strong top-line revenue growth in the third quarter with strength across all regions. The Americas saw solid volume in both the non-residential and residential businesses, as end-market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals.Price was very strong in the Americas and remain firmed in Europe. Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rebound nicely in the quarter. Acquisitions continue to contribute to total company revenue growth. Electronics growth globally continues to accelerate and was quite substantial during the quarter, led by the Americas region, which saw nearly 30% growth in electronic products during the quarter. We see the electronics growth outlook continuing to be a long-term positive trend, as more and more products become connected for ease of access.We are driving price realization and productivity actions in an effort to mitigate the substantial inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We did experience margin declines in the quarter as acquisitions were diluted. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary pressures and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions.In the third quarter, we delivered robust EPS growth, seeing more than 20% expansion in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations and tax rate benefits. This EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value.Last, we are raising our outlook for revenue and EPS. Total revenue growth is projected to be between 13% and 13.5%, raising from our previous range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Organic revenue is being increased to a range of 5% to 5.5%, up from the 4% to 5% provided last quarter. For adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $4.43 to $4.50 per share, bringing up the low end of our previous outlook, which was $4.35 to $4.50.Please go to slide 5. In Q3, Allegion delivered strong top-line revenue performance. Revenue from the third quarter with $711.5 million, an increase of 16.8%, inclusive of organic growth of 8.5%. Benefits from acquisition also contributed to the top-line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact.All regions grew organically. America led the way with organic growth of just over 10% in the quarter, supported by robust growth in electronics, strong pricing, and solid volume in both the nonresidential and residential businesses.The EMEIA regions saw organic growth of 3.4% and Asia-Pacific organic growth rebounded nicely, coming in at nearly 6%. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 140 basis points due to the dilution related to our acquisitions made earlier this year. Excluding the impact of those acquisitions, the base operating margins were flat year-over-year as the business did a good job of driving price realization and productivity savings to combat continued inflationary pressures.",
                 'AGN': "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Daphne Karydas. Please go ahead, ma'am.Daphne Karydas - Allergan PlcThank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone.

Also on the call and available during the Q&A is Bob Bailey, our Chief Legal Officer.With that, I will turn the call over to Brent.Brenton L. Saunders - Allergan PlcThanks, Daphne, and thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter earnings call this morning. Let's turn to slide 5. As we approach year-end, our business continues to show strong momentum across the board. Our focus on execution is evident in our performance, and we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We remain on track to meet our commitments as we advance our strategy to strengthen our leadership position in our four key therapeutic areas.Our third quarter performance highlights are strategic focus and the durability of our business. Our Medical Aesthetics business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. As a global leader in the fast-growing market that is expected to double in the next five to seven years, we see exceptional prospects to continue to grow this business. At our Medical Aesthetics Day in September, we provided further insights into the trends and dynamics that are driving the medical aesthetics market and our business.In CNS, VRAYLAR and BOTOX Therapeutic continue to be our anchors, each growing at double-digit rates again in the third quarter. And concerning the richness of our CNS pipeline, the long-term outlook for our CNS business is very good.We continue to demonstrate significant progress in our pipeline with a number of potential key launches over the next three years. This quarter, we sold our medical dermatology assets and acquired Bonti to continue to sharpen our focus. Finally, we continued to generate robust cash flows and maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation with a strong balance sheet, strategic growth investments and capital returned to our shareholders. We achieved all of this in a quarter where we also experienced some near-term headwinds, some of which were unexpected.During the third quarter, we recalled OZURDEX in certain international markets. David will go over the details, but importantly, the issue that drove the recall was self-identified and no related safety issues have been reported to date. Patient safety is always our number one priority, and we have already implemented corrective actions. We expect to restart the supply of OZURDEX in the impacted markets before the end of this year.Unfavorable currency movements, LOEs and ongoing pressure from payers have been felt industry-wide and we are well positioned to effectively manage through them. Given our strong underlying business momentum in each of our core therapeutic areas and our confidence in driving solid sales and earnings growth, we are raising our outlook for full year 2018.",
                 'ADS': 'Vikki NakhlaThank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the company’s third quarter 2018 earnings release. If you haven’t, please call Advisory Partners at (212) 750-5800. On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today’s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the company’s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call. Also on today’s call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at alliancedata.com.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan. Ed?Ed HeffernanThanks, Vikki. With me today as always is Charles Horn, our CFO. He’ll update you on the third quarter results and then I will update everyone on our 2018 outlook, talk a little bit about some of the things we have going on and initial thoughts about 2019. We’ll try to get through this and have plenty of time for Q&A. So, Charles?Charles HornThanks, Ed. Pro-forma revenue increased 5% to $2 billion for the third quarter of 2018, led by strong performances at LoyaltyOne and Card Services. EPS increased 28% to $5.39 for the third quarter of 2018, while core EPS increased 17% to $6.26, both aided by lower effective tax rate. That flips in the fourth quarter as we expect a 24% core effective tax rate compared to 14% in the fourth quarter of 2017.Turning to capital deployment, we spent approximately $103 million in share repurchases during the third quarter while dropping our corporate leverage ratio to 2.4x compared to our covenant of 3.5x. Year-to-date we have repurchased slightly over 1 million shares or about 2% of outstanding shares. Cash flow will continue to be used – continue to support share repurchases in our quarterly dividend but will also be used to reduce our corporate leverage ratio to 2.2x or lower by year end. Let’s turn to a recent hot topic which is CECL, the new accounting standard impacting loan loss reserving. The new accounting standard uses the life of the loan methodology to determine expected credit losses. The life of the loan approach is widely viewed as replacing the loss emergence period creating the potential for estimates to cover a longer loss horizon.We are in the early stages for implementation of the standard but the preliminary thought is at that the life of the credit card loan will be less than 12 months of coverage we currently reserve. Key in the determination of the allowance is the ability to provide reasonable and supportable forecast over the life of the loan. Again because we expect the life of credit card loan to be reasonably short, we believe our current forecasting process would cover that period as opposed to those with mortgage or auto loans, which have significantly longer life. In summary, we do not expect the new accounting standard to have any impact to our months coverage.Let’s go to next page and talk about the segments. Starting with LoyaltyOne pro forma revenue increased 8% to $329 million. Breaking down the quarter, AIR MILES’ pro forma revenue decreased 6% from the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to a lower burn rate, that’s the number of miles redeemed and a weaker Canadian dollar. AIR MILES issued increased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2017, benefiting from increased promotional activity by the Bank of Montreal. BrandLoyalty’s revenue increased 29% from the third quarter of 2017 and we expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter.Turning to Epsilon, revenue decreased 4% to $538 million. Similar to the first half of 2018, combined revenue for our agency and side-based offerings were down double-digits. However, through strong expense management and the favorable shift in revenue mix, we maintained the same level of adjusted EBITDA as of third quarter 2017.Lastly, Card Services revenue increased 10% to $1.16 billion, consistent with the growth in average card receivables, while adjusted EBITDA net increased 4% to $414.3 million. Net loss rates improved sequentially by 50 basis points as the recovery rate improved from high single digits in the first quarter to slightly over 18% in the third quarter. The third quarter reserve rate decreased slightly to 6.5% due to expectations of further improvements in the net principal loss rate in the fourth quarter. The delinquency rate remains slightly elevated primarily due to a slowing growth rate in card receivables, essentially what we call growth map.',
                 'LNT': "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy.Susan GilleGood morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are Pat Kampling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Larsen, President; and Robert Durian, Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; as well as other members of the senior management team. Following prepared remarks by Pat, John and Robert, we will take time to take questions from the investment community.We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2018 earnings guidance range and announced the 2019 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. We also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2022 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2023 through 2027. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and non-GAAP measures are provided in our earnings release and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat.Patricia KamplingThanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid financial and operational results. Third quarter did benefit from higher sales through the warmer weather -- the warmer than normal temperatures we enjoyed. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share of $1.83 included $0.05 benefit from temperature. Therefore, we are updating our earnings guidance range to $2.13 to $2.19 per share with the new midpoint of $2.16, $0.05 higher than our original guidance for the year. Based on our forecast, 2018 will mark the sixth year in a row that we've achieved at least 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. Robert will provide more details on quarterly results later on the call.Now, let's focus on 2019. The midpoint of our earnings guidance range is $2.24 per share, which is a 6% increase to our forecast of 2018 temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.11 as shown on Slide 2. This is consistent with our long-term earnings growth objective of 5% to 7% per year through 2022. Additionally, you'll be pleased to know that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase of our targeted 2019 annual common stock dividend to $1.42 per share, consistent with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.We also issued our 2018 to 2022 capital expenditure plan totaling $7 billion as shown on Slide 3. For your convenience, we provided a walk from the previous capital plan to our current plan on Slide 4.Gas and electric distribution spend did increase in all the years. I would like to point out that the gas distribution CapEx increase of $155 million in 2020 is driven mostly by several anticipated gas expansion projects in Wisconsin. The $205 million decrease in renewables in 2019 was driven mostly by revisions and the timing of our wind expansion spend since we now have finalized our in-service dates for each project. Also, we now assume that the transmission upgrade at the wind farms will be the responsibility of the transmission operators and therefore reduce CapEx for these projects.In the press release, you will notice that we also mentioned that our capital expenditure plan for 2023 through 2027 is currently $5.7 billion, making a 10-year plan total of $12.7 billion. Over 1/2 of our 10-year CapEx plan is for investments in electric and gas distribution systems. These investments will expand automation, standardize voltages and increase underground distribution to make the grid more resilient and improve delivery to customers. We are also working closely with several of our communities to expand our systems in anticipation of economic development opportunities they are pursuing.And speaking of our communities, mother nature was kind to many areas across our service territories during the third quarter. Several of our communities are still being impacted by the devastation caused by tornadoes and major flooding. Marshalltown, Iowa continues the rebuilding process after an EF-3 tornado caused catastrophic damage in July. And in Wisconsin, dozens of homes and businesses suffered major damage during the severe flood that occurred in August and September. This was a challenging summer for many and it has taken an incredible effort by our employees to safely restore service and to generously assist our customers and communities with their time and financial assistance.",
                 'ALL': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.John Griek - The Allstate Corp.Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After our prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.Yesterday, following the close of the market, we filed the 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the news release, investor supplement, and today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results.As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks.Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.Good morning. Thank you for joining to stay current on Allstate's operating results.Let's begin on slide 2, so the headline year is Allstate's businesses continued to deliver growth and attractive returns. Our strategy is working. We're on pace to achieve our five 2018 operating priorities.At the Property-Liability, year-to-date underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the annual outlook range or for nine months for a close to the bottom of the annual outlook, which is good, as you know. The net result was excellent financial results. We also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, of which up to $1 billion may be funded with perpetual preferred stock.To go to the table, revenues increased to $10.5 billion, almost $600 million above the prior year quarter. Net income was $833 million in the third quarter of 2018 and adjusted net income per share was $1.93 million, which is 20.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Net income return on equity for the latest 12 months was 17.4% and 15.9% on an adjusted net income basis.Now, let's start on a more macro perspective before we dig into the details. So if you go to slide 3, Allstate's strategy is to grow market share in the personal Property-Liability businesses while expanding our other protection businesses. So, to start with the upper oval, the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and we serve each of these with a differentiated branded product offering. So Allstate agencies provide customers with personal guidance through 38,000 professionals and over 10,000 agencies in nearly every community in America.The Esurance on the other hand provides over 1.6 million policies to customers who prefer to purchase their products online or through a call center. We use this sophisticated analytics across all these businesses to ensure we grow profitability and are at the forefront to using telematics-based offerings. We're building an integrated digital enterprise that uses data analytics technology and process redesign to improve both our effectiveness and our efficiency. For example, we are a leader in using consumer generated – or customer generated photos to quickly settle auto insurance claims.Our strategy also includes expanding other protection businesses by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution and capital, which are listed in the lower oval and that obviously began in 1957 with life insurance. In 1999, we acquired Allstate Benefits, which provides protection product such as life and disability insurance to employees at the work site. And by leveraging our resources, this business has had a compound annual growth rate of 7% for 18 years.We purchased SquareTrade at the beginning of 2017 and it's growing rapidly and achieving our acquisition objectives. And this year, we also began offering insurance to transportation networks companies such as through Allstate business insurance. And we recently closed the acquisition of InfoArmor, which further expands our portfolio of person identity protection products and services.So, this two part strategy then creates shareholder value in a number of different ways through customer satisfaction, unit growth, attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform.So, if you turn to slide 4 then as to what we're doing in 2018, the operating priorities we communicate to you and to our employees and teammates. The first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base.

                 'GOOG': "Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues.Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in cloud for both technical and sales roles.Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items.Other income and expense was $1.8 billion which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.",
                 'MO': "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Marshall (00:36), Vice President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.Unverified ParticipantThank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're here this morning with Howard Willard, Altria's CEO; and Billy Gifford, Altria's CFO, to discuss Altria's 2018 third quarter and first nine months business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing these results, which is available on our website at altria.com and through the Altria Investor app.During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2017. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements, and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statement section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release.With that, I'll turn the call over to Howard.Howard A. Willard - Altria Group, Inc.Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Altria delivered excellent third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 20% and continued to return large amounts of cash to our shareholders. Our tobacco businesses are successfully executing against their strategies, while making strategic investments to drive long-term success. Before moving to our third quarter results, I'd like to address recent FDA activity.In September, the FDA asked several companies, including Altria, to provide plans to address underage use of e-vapor products. We welcomed FDA's action and we agreed that the reported rise in underage use of e-vapor products is alarming and immediate action should be taken. We're also concerned that use of e-vapor products may jeopardize the harm reduction opportunity for e-vapor. We recently met with Commissioner Gottlieb to discuss steps that could be taken to address underage access and use.Consistent with our discussion with the FDA and because we believe in the long-term promise of e-vapor products and harm reduction, we're taking immediate action to address this complex situation. First, Nu Mark will remove from the market MarkTen Elite and Apex by MarkTen pod-based products until these products receive a market order from the FDA or the youth issue is otherwise addressed.Second, for our remaining MarkTen and Green Smoke cig-a-like products, Nu Mark will sell only tobacco, menthol and mint varieties. Nu Mark will discontinue the sale of all other flavor variants of our cig-a-like products until these products receive a market order from the FDA or the youth issue is otherwise addressed. Although we don't believe we have a current issue with youth access or use of our e-vapor products, we are taking this action because we don't want to risk contributing to the issue.Additionally, we will support federal legislation to establish 21 as the minimum age to purchase any tobacco product. We think it makes sense to accomplish this through a phased-in approach. For context, we estimate that approximately 5% of adult tobacco consumers are legal age through 20, and that this age demographic represents approximately 2% of cigarette industry volumes, 4% of smokeless industry volumes and 15% of e-vapor industry volumes.We, of course, recognize the impacts these decisions will have on our consumers, trade partners, suppliers and others. We believe these actions are essential to addressing the youth e-vapor epidemic and preserving the long-term harm reduction opportunity for e-vapor products. We support adult tobacco consumer choice and the promise of tobacco harm reduction, and we fully intend to operate compelling portfolio of e-vapor products for adult smokers and vapers.Through the FDA's product review pathways all but (05:08) underage use of e-vapor is addressed. After removing Nu Mark's pod-based products and cig-a-like flavor variants, approximately 80% of Nu Mark's e-vapor volume in the third quarter of 2018 will remain on the market. These actions are outlined in our written response to the FDA, which was posted earlier this morning to altria.com.With that, let's move now to our operating results. The smokeable products segment performed in line with our expectations, while adjusted operating companies income in the third quarter was essentially flat from the prior year, PM USA continues to make progress stabilizing Marlboro share through investments in the brand's equity. Marlboro's retail share decreased 0.1 of a share point in the third quarter to 43.1%, but is unchanged from its fourth quarter 2017 share. Billy will provide additional detail on our brand equity investments in a minute.",
                 'AMZN': "For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc.Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular.I'll just remind you that the units – those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units.In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc.And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.",
                 'AEE': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.Andrew KirkThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Lyons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Warner and Marty will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that's accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com Web site home page that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on page two of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as Forward-Looking Statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the Forward-Looking Statement section in the news release we issued today and the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC.Lastly, all our per share earnings amounts discussed today during today's presentation including earnings guidance are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted.Now here's Warner, who will start on page four of the presentation.Warner BaxterThanks, Andrew. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we announced third quarter 2018 core earnings of $1.50 per share compared to core earnings of $1.24 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Third quarter 2018 results exclude non-cash non-core charge of $0.05 per share related to federal income tax reform.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher retail sales, primarily due to warmer summer temperatures, as well as earnings on increased infrastructure investments. The comparison also benefited from timing differences related to federal income tax reform, which we do not expect will impact full-year results. Marty will discuss these and other factors driving the quarterly results in more detail in a moment.I am also pleased to report that we continue to successfully execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which I will touch on in more detail in a few moments.That fact [ph], and coupled with strong retail sales primarily due to the warm summer weather enabled us to raise our 2018 earnings guidance for the second time this year. Our 2018 core earnings guidance range is now $3.35 per share to $3.45 per share, up from our prior GAAP and core guidance range of $3.15 per share to $3.35 per share.Moving to page five, here we reiterate our strategic plan which we have been executing very well throughout 2018, and over the last several years. That plans is expected to continue to result in strong long-term investments and earnings growth. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This strategy has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers in jurisdictions that are supported by modern, constructive regulatory frameworks.Today, I am pleased to say that we are allocating meaningful amounts of capital to each of our business segments as all are now operating under constructive frameworks. On September 1st, Ameren Missouri began using plant and service accounting enabled by Senate Bill 564. This legislation improves our ability to earn a fair return on Ameren Missouri capital investments, and will drive significant incremental investments in energy infrastructure in the future. I'll say more about Senate Bill 564 in a moment. But it is safe to say that we are excited to bring many of the same infrastructure investment benefits to Missouri that our Illinois customers enjoy today.Speaking about our Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas distribution operations, we invested approximately $625 million in Illinois electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure projects in the first nine months of this year, including those that are part of Ameren Illinois' modernization action plans. The electric projects, enabled by the Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, have exceeded the job creation goals, and we are on track to meet or exceed our investment, reliability, and advance metering goals. Ameren Illinois customers are experiencing fewer and shorter power outages as a result of electric grid upgrades.Since the modernization program began in 2012, the installation of storm-resilient utility poles, automated switches, and an upgraded distribution grid have resulted in a 19% reduction in annual electricity service interruptions on average. And when customers do experience an outage, Ameren Illinois is restoring power 17% faster on average than prior to when the program began. Further, installations of advanced electric meters and gas meter modules were either on or ahead of schedule. Through the end of September, Ameren Illinois has installed about 985,000 smart electric meters, and 510,000 gas meter modules that provide customers with enhanced energy usage data and access to programs to help them save on their energy bills.",
                 'AAL': "And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens.Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc.Thanks, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Finance Officer. Also in the room for a question-and-answer session are several of our senior executives, including Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Elise Eberwein: our EVP of People & Communications; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management.Like we normally do, Doug will start the call with an overview of our financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the third quarter and provide some additional information on guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment. And then, after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that was also issued this morning.In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as pre-tax profit and CASM, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call will be archived on the website as well, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently.Thanks again for joining us. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc.Thanks, Dan. Thanks everyone for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 pre-tax profit of $688 million, excluding net special items. Those results include our highest ever revenue performance, thanks to our 130,000 hard-working team members. But unfortunately, a rising fuel prices outpaced that increase in revenues. Higher jet fuel prices alone increased our quarterly expenses by over $750 million versus the same quarter last year. And therefore, our pre-tax earnings, excluding specials for the quarter, were $485 million lower than the third quarter 2017.The declining earnings has been met with a declining stock price, which neither we nor our investors are happy about. The good news is, we're extremely bullish on the future of American and for good reason. This disconnect between the stock price and our view of the future seems to us like a buying opportunity, and we're happy to be here to talk to you all about it.So, look, there are five reasons that we're so bullish. First, we have extensive revenue initiatives underway that are expected to bring more than $1 billion in revenue improvements to American in 2019 versus 2018. Importantly, the drivers of this value are not share shift because of a better product like new airplanes or industry-leading Wi-Fi or world-class clubs and lounges, though we certainly believe some upside exist in that regard. This is a value that'll happen as we simply execute against known projects such as project segmentation, fleet reconfiguration and international network restructuring.Second, and we also expect about $300 million in cost improvements in 2019 versus this year. That's the result of our One Airline project, which has been expanded and accelerated in light of higher fuel costs and Derek will discuss that further.Third, we have the opportunity to grow where we have a real competitive advantage. We have, what we believe, will be the lowest growth plans in the industry for 2019, but we also have what we believe are the best growth prospects. We have 15 gates opening at our largest and most profitable hub in Dallas/Fort Worth in early 2019. We have routes in and out of Dallas/Fort Worth that will immediately generate higher than average profitability versus the marginal profitability that airline growth usually generates.Fourth, we're dedicated to improving our operating reliability. And we've been steadily improving the operating reliability of American according to plan in each year since our merger in late 2013. But that trend changed in the summer of 2018, and we backed (00:05:04) a little bit. As Robert will discuss, we've rededicated ourselves to producing the best operational reliability since our merger in 2019 and that's our top corporate priority. The work has already begun showing some great results, so this is an even more upside for 2019.And then fifth, we are nearing the end of our major post-merger capital expenditure requirement. Our capital expenditures in American have averaged $5.3 billion per year in the five years since the merger. That over $25 billion is by far the most any carrier has invested in its fleet, product and team in the history of commercial aviation. And the result is a valuable set of assets that'll serve our shareholders well for decades to come.And we're going to spend a little under $5 billion in 2019 as we have one more aircraft order to fund. But after that, we're largely done with the backlog. And our CapEx drops precipitously to approximately $3 billion in 2020, $2 billion in 2021 and we expect it will remain in the $2 billion to $3 billion range thereafter.So, because of all of those items, we're excited about our near and long-term future. We're confident that American will return to revenue outperformance and earnings growth in 2019 and beyond. Now, it sounds like we're extremely optimistic because we are, but please don't mistake confidence for indifference. We're extremely focused on results and execution and completing the hard work necessary to deliver this value. We've just happen to be confident it will happen because we know we have the right plan in place and the right people to deliver it. We look forward to proving that over time.And with that, I'll turn it over to Derek and Robert.",
                 'AEP': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.I will now turn the call over to Nick.Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's third quarter 2018 earnings call. We just completed another financially strong quarter given positive weather results, continued economic growth, albeit moderated in most sectors of the economy, and continued resolution of regulatory related matters. The headlines for this quarter are not only that our board decided to raise the quarterly dividend by 8.1% to $0.67 a share earlier this week, we're also adjusting our 2018 guidance range upward from $3.75 to $3.95 per share to $3.88 to $3.98 per share.The economy in our service territory continues to grow mainly in oil and gas-related industries, with others such as chemical industries, primary metals, et cetera, are tempering because of tariffs and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Brian will cover that in more detail, but overall, AEP continues to deliver on its commitment of providing steady, consistent dividend growth commensurate with the long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% to 7%.As for the specifics for the quarter and the year-to-date, GAAP and operating earnings for third quarter 2018 came in at $1.17 per share and $1.26 per share, respectively, versus third quarter 2017 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.11 and $1.10 per share, respectively. This brings 2018 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.17 per share and $3.23 per share, respectively, versus 2017 GAAP, and operating earnings of $3.07 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively.The difference between GAAP and operating for the quarter and for year-to-date 2018 are primarily due to an impairment taken related to the Racine Hydroelectric Plant, severance charges taken in response to announced plant closures, and economic hedging activities. This has been another very positive quarter financially and operationally that should bode well for ending the year in a positive fashion.Because of our belief that we are and continue to be on a firm 5% to 7% earnings trajectory buoyed by a strong base plan into the future, our board was very comfortable increasing the dividend by 8.1%, well within our 60% to 70% targeted payout ratio.Moving to the regulatory activity, at this point, the notable rate case activity really includes Oklahoma and APCo West Virginia. In late September, we filed another base case in Oklahoma at PSO, our third try to correct the chronic under earning situation in Oklahoma. This case has a requested net increase of $68 million with an ROE of 10.3%.We have proposed a performance-based rate mechanism that adjusts for certain customer satisfaction and quality of service metrics with the intent of reducing the regulatory lag while ensuring a positive customer experience. The proposed procedural schedule has now been set that provides for interim rates subject to refund going into effect in April of 2019. We are certainly hoping for a better outcome based upon the operational performance of PSO over the years, a financially healthy PSO would be well deserved.Regarding the West Virginia case that was filed back in early May, we received staff and other intervener testimony that while disappointing regarding adjustments such as a lower ROE, exclusion of certain known reasonable expenses after the test year and lower depreciation rates, we still believe there is an opportunity to enter into constructive settlement discussions to achieve a more reasonable outcome. Procedural schedules have been set in this case with an expected order in late February, with rates going into effect in March 2019.So now, I'll move to the equalizer chart. I'm going to hold off on a discussion of the premier regulated energy company until a little bit later. But as we look at the equalizer chart, I call it that because it sort of looks like it with the balls of different sizes of the companies, overall, we're seeing a 10.1% ROE. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be at or near the 10% range.",
                 'AXP': "And I’ll now turn the meeting over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Edmund Reese. Please go ahead, sir.Edmund ReeseThank you, Lori. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials from prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of Q3 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results, with both Steve and Jeff.With that, let me turn it over to Steve.Steve SqueriThanks, Edmund and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with some of the key highlights from the third quarter results we released earlier this afternoon. From there, I'll give an overview of the year-to-date results. And before turning it over to Jeff for a more detailed discussion of our financial performance, I’ll provide a quick progress report on the four strategic imperatives that we focused the organization on at the beginning of the year.In the third quarter, we saw a continued momentum in our business that was in line with the strong growth of the first half. Adjusted revenues grew 10% and we delivered EPS of $1.88. I feel really good about the company's performance. We’ve had several quarters of high revenue growth and in fact this marks the sixth consecutive quarter with adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%. Our growth has been broad based, driven by a well balanced mix of card member spending, fees and loans and spread across geographies, businesses and customer segments.We have continued to control our operating expenses and that provides the flexibility to make investments in our brand, customer benefits and digital capabilities. As I reflect on the first nine months of the year, I see very consistent and positive trends. We generated a healthy level of top line revenue growth and delivered strong bottom line results each quarter. Year-to-date, our revenue growth is 10% and our earnings per share growth is slightly higher than that, after adjusting for the tax act of 2017.We're gaining spending and lending share in almost all the countries in which we operate. At the same time, our customer engagement expenses, which are composed of rewards, card member services and marketing are growing a little faster than revenue. We are seeing very good payback from the targeted enhancements we've made to our customer value propositions. But that does translate into some margin pressure.The remainder of our cost on operating expenses. For us, these are primarily scalable infrastructure costs and they are growing at a much slower rate than revenues. So in effect, the margin compression created by higher customer engagement expenses is being partially offset by OpEx leverage. And as many of you know, we have a proven track record of disciplined control on operating expenses, while growing the rest of the business. We're delivering strong results in a highly competitive and regulated environment where there are higher costs associated with driving growth. And going forward, we are focused on sustaining the high levels of revenue growth that have been delivering steady and consistent double digit EPS growth. We believe that the best way to do that is to invest in share, scale and relevance for the long term.Turning back to our year-to-date performance, we feel good about the advantages that come from our integrated business model and the progress we're making on our four strategic imperatives, which I'll take you through now. We continue to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space. We introduced the new Gold Card in the US with an enhanced value proposition and an innovative set of rewards. We continued to refresh our international product line with enhancements to our Platinum Card in Australia, Singapore in Japan. The US Platinum Card continued its strong performance. New consumer accounts are up more than 50% and about half of those are for millennials. Building on our strong position in commercial payments, small and medium sized businesses continue to be our fastest growing customer segment worldwide, with particular strength in our international regions. Continuing to strengthen our global integrated network, we continue to add more places worldwide, where American Express cards are accepted.While I could expand much more in our progress in these first three areas, today, I want to focus more on our fourth priority, making American Express a more essential part of our customers’ digital lives. Given the announcement we made earlier today about an expanded relationship with PayPal, I wanted to put the many things we are doing here in context. Over the past year, we've steadily gained traction on this critical imperative that cuts across every part of our integrated business model.",
                 'AIG': 'Good day and welcome to the AIG’s Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.Liz WernerThank you, April.AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today’s presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in the slides for today’s presentation and our financial supplement, both of which are available on our website. As a reminder, for this morning’s call, our Q&A session will have one question with one follow-up. Please get back into queue, if you would like to ask additional questions.On this morning’s call, you’ll hear from our senior management team including CEO, Brian Duperreault; CFO, Sid Sankaran; CEO of GI, Peter Zaffino; GI’s Chief Actuary, Mark Lyons; and CEO of L&R, Kevin Hogan.At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Brian.Brian DuperreaultThank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone.Our third quarter results reflected volatility due to 14 global catastrophes, particularly the Japan typhoons. We continue to execute on our reinsurance strategy, one of our key initiatives, which I will cover in a more detail and which Peter will also review in his remarks. Other actions we’re taking to improve our underwriting capabilities and profitability are taking hold, and we started to see some of the resulting benefits in our third quarter results.We continue to expect to deliver an underwriting profit including AAL for General Insurance as we exit 2018. Over the course of the last year, Peter and his team have made significant progress in executing on our reinsurance strategy. And this work will continue as we approach the January 1 renewal season. So far this year, we’ve lowered our North American CAT cover attachment point from a per occurrence of $1.5 billion to an aggregate of $750 million and added an additional international cover.As you will hear from Peter in his remarks, AIG’s national market share in Japan is 6%, and in the area most impacted, it’s 10% on the average. While our Japan reinsurance program was renewed in January 2018 maintaining its historical structure which included two separate towers for the commercial and personal insurance business, we have been working diligently throughout this year to get a single structure in place for 2019 to reduce our net exposure on both a frequency and severity basis. We are pleased with the contributions and balance that Validus brings to our business mix. The disciplined underwriting and risk approach that Validus takes was most evident this quarter in the estimated net CAT loss of approximately $200 million, which was in line with peers. Validus was neutral to our accident year results quarter this quarter and remains on track to contribute approximately 1 point to a combined ratio improvement as we exit 2018.Our recent announcement of the pending acquisition of Glatfelter will provide further balance to General Insurance by improving our position in the programs market with the addition of one of the most respected firms in this space to our portfolio of businesses. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur next week.Turning to reserves, we welcome Mark Lyons, to the team this summer, and he has hit the ground running in reviewing our actuarial processes and procedures. Net reserve additions of $170 million in the third quarter reflect the work Mark and his team performed relating to approximately 75% of our book. Year-to-date, net reserves development was flat.Peter will provide an additional detail on General Insurance in his prepared remarks. And Mark is joining the call and will give you more color on the work he has done on General Insurance reserves.L&R delivered another solid quarter, notwithstanding challenging year-over-year comparisons that reflect the impact of annual assumption reviews. Underlying ROE continued in double digits, and in particular our investments in businesses over the last few years are beginning to bear fruit with strong growth in Individual Retirement and life in particular. Sid will discuss the results of the third quarter actuarial review and Kevin will elaborate on the performance of this well-positioned business, which serves some of the most -- the world’s most important needs, the need for sources of savings, lifetime income, and protection. Our steps to reduce exposures on our Legacy book and to allocate capital more efficiently underscore our capital management discipline and focus on long-term shareholder value. The sale of 19.9% of Fortitude Re, formerly known as DSA Re, to the Carlyle Group is imminent and will free up capital as well as provide a platform for potential growth.',
                 'AMT': "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Igor Khislavsky. Please go ahead.Igor Khislavsky - American Tower Corp.Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We've posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows.First, I'll provide a few highlights from our financial results. Next, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and CEO, will provide some brief commentary focusing on key technology trends in the U.S. And finally, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and updated full year outlook. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.Before I begin I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include, our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2018 outlook; capital allocation and future operating performance; the pacing and magnitude of Indian carrier consolidation and its impacts on American Tower; assumptions around our pending and recently closed acquisitions and other transactions; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts.You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and in the other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.Now please turn to slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. During the quarter, our property revenue grew 5.8% to $1.75 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 5.3% to nearly $1.1 billion. Our consolidated adjusted funds from operations grew about 10% to $821 million, and consolidated AFFO per share increased by nearly 7% to $1.85. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by about 23% to $367 million, or $0.83 per diluted common share.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.James D. Taiclet - American Tower Corp.Thanks, Igor, and good morning to everyone on the call.The highlight of our third quarter was our U.S. property segment organic tenant billings growth of 7.4%, leading us to raise our 2018 expectations for that metric to above 7% for the full year. Unlimited data plans and increasing mobile video consumption continue to drive additional spectrum deployments and equipment installations by our domestic tenants to support 4G network technology, and that's leading to those elevated growth rates.Moreover, our major U.S. customers are beginning to embark on tangible plans for 5G technology, which provides a relevant backdrop to our usual third quarter topic of technology development. But before getting into the details of those trends, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our comprehensive agreement with Tata, which I'm pleased to disclose in this morning's press release.We've been working amicably with the Tata Group for nearly a year to reach an agreement that satisfies three main objectives for us while also respecting our partner's goals of an orderly exit from both the mobile business and from our tower joint venture. Those three objectives for ATC which we believe we've attained through this agreement, were to: first, preserve our ability to achieve American Tower's long-term return on investment targets in India by securing economic value for Tata Teleservices leases to be terminated while at the same time retaining a portion of the run rate through new leases with other Tata Group businesses; second, to better position ATC India for growth in the post-consolidation phase of the Indian mobile market in the 2020 timeframe and beyond; and thirdly, to set the timeline to evolve the joint venture through the replacement of Tata as a partner with either increased ATC ownership, an additional partner, or some combination.Tom will provide additional details of the agreement during his remarks, so now let's jump into our regularly scheduled technology discussion. My remarks are focused today on technology trends in the U.S., which remains our largest market, generating the bulk of our company's cash flows. We also expect that over time, these trends will follow across our international markets.As I noted earlier, the overwhelming driver of tower demand today is 4G technology, and we believe that will remain the case well into the 2020s. However, as momentum for 5G builds, a number of trends in network deployments are expected to increasingly contribute to our demand profile as well.",

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As always, after my opening remarks, you will hear from our COO, Walter Lynch on regulated business highlights. And then our CFO, Linda Sullivan on third quarter financial results. However, Linda will join me in a few minutes as we talk a bit more about our Keystone operations before turning it over to Walter.We’re pleased to report another strong quarter of performance. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share were up 11.1% compared to 2017 and our nine months year-to-date grew 11.5% year-over-year. The foundation for our growth continues to be the capital investment we make in regulated operations. We invested a total of $1.5 billion during the first nine months of the year with $1.1 billion for regulated infrastructure and $383 million for acquisitions, which includes our acquisition of Pivotal.We had several positive events this quarter, which Walter will discuss more fully in just a few minutes. To mention just a few, we received a BPU approved settlement in our New Jersey rate case and reached a stipulated agreement with a consumer advocate and PSC staff in West Virginia. We received a unanimous five to zero vote by the California Public Utilities Commission for our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which includes both water reuse capabilities and a desalination facility.We’re also pleased to get clarifying legislation to exempt water and wastewater utilities from the 2018 New Jersey tax law changes. We continue to have strong regulated customer growth. To date, we have welcomed about 16,500 new customer connections through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 56,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisition. Walter will give you more detail shortly.Our adjusted earnings increase of over 11% was also driven by growth in our market-based businesses. We’re pleased to share that our homeowners services financial results to date are above projections with both excellent operating performance and Pivotal integration expenses favorable compared to our plan. We look forward to fully integrating the business and realizing synergies in the future.Our legacy Homeowner Services Group has had several wins this year. Most recently we announced formal partnerships with the city of Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana. We also have received notices from San Francisco and Toledo, Ohio of their preliminary intent to award partnerships to us following final negotiations.Additionally, we were pleased to announce last month that our Military Services Group won a 50 year, $591 million contract to serve Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri. We are very proud to grow to 14 basis, where we serve quality water, fire protection and sanitation services to the incredible men and women and their families who serve our nation and defend our liberties. And as we have already shared, we sell the majority of our Contract Services Group to Veolia in July. We are recognizing a positive $0.06 of benefit from that sale this quarter as a non-GAAP item.',
                 'AMP': "I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.Alicia A. Charity - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Thank you, Operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insights into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2017 Annual Report to shareholders, and our 2017 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.Turning to slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. In the third quarter, we completed our annual unlocking. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results excluding unlocking.And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Hello and thank you for joining our earnings call. This morning, we'll discuss our strong results, give you an update on the business, and our areas of focus today and going forward. Reflecting on the quarter, the macroeconomic and market picture has been positive for our clients and Ameriprise. The U.S. economy is strong, and that was punctuated by the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates again.However, Europe is showing signs of slower growth. Global trade issues and political uncertainty remain, including in the UK, especially as the deadline for Brexit nears. Recently, global equity markets have been more volatile. We're navigating that volatility and are very much focused on our clients.At the same time, consumer sentiment is strong. U.S. household wealth has reached a new high of over $100 trillion, which represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Ameriprise.Turning to the company, over the years, we've built a strong business. We're well positioned based on our broad advice capability and our integrated model allows us to leverage resources and generates consistent results through market cycles. Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter. On an adjusted operating basis, excluding unlocking, revenue increased nicely, up 5%.We continue to generate excellent EPS growth, the third consecutive quarter of 20% growth or better, building on last year's strong results. And our return on equity was also very strong, now at 32%.I am pleased with the quarter and our long-standing track record for delivering results of this caliber. In addition, our assets under management and administration are now over $900 billion. As you know, our business generates significant free cash flow and we're disciplined in our capital allocation. We continue to shift our earnings mix to less capital-intensive business lines, with more than 70% of pre-tax adjusted operating earnings coming from our Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses in the quarter.At various investment forums over the years, some of you have asked us when we would grow our less capital-intensive business lines to get to 50% or even 60%. Today, we're over 70%. And we have the ability to continue to invest for growth and return to shareholders at a meaningful level.Let's move to some business highlights. Very clearly, we know the mass affluent and affluent want to work in a personal advice-based relationship with a trusted advisor. And these investors need either more advice as their assets grow, their lives become more complex, and markets experience volatility. At Ameriprise, we're positioned very well to serve this growing need. We're focused on serving more investors in our target market, those with $500,000 to $5 million, and we're seeing good organic growth at the $1 million-plus level.With good client growth and positive markets, Ameriprise client assets increased 9% to $588 billion. Our investment advisory platform is one of the largest in the industry. Net inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts were $5.7 billion in the quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of flows over $5 billion. And year-to-date, wrap flows are 14% higher than 2017, which was an exceptionally strong year.",
                 'ABC': "I would now like to turn the call over to your first speaker, Mr. Bennett Murphy. Please go ahead.Bennett Murphy - AmerisourceBergen Corp.Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss the AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2018 third quarter financial results. I am Bennett Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations for AmerisourceBergen, and joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman President and CEO; and Tim Guttman, Executive Vice President and CFO.On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which we use to assess the underlying performance of our business.

We do ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants and inquiries as we can within the hour.With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?Steven H. Collis - AmerisourceBergen Corp.Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. Our continued focus on operational excellence helped us deliver a strong third quarter with revenue increasing 11% to $43 billion and adjusted diluted EPS growing 8% to $1.54. Our ability to consistently execute and maximize our opportunities for growth has helped us successfully navigate an evolving market landscape and overcome internal challenges, including the lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium this year, putting us in a strong position to finish fiscal 2018 on track and within our guidance range.We believe our results demonstrate the value that our businesses are creating for our manufacturer and provider partners and reinforce our long-term prospects for growth despite any near-term uncertainty. The importance of our work and our ability to consistently execute was on full display across our businesses during the third quarter. Over the past several weeks and months, many people have asked about the landscape for our industry and questioned our ability to adapt if there are changes to the model. In times like these I believe it's important to take a step back and look at our results in the context of the value we provide and the critical work we've already done to innovate in a fast changing market.In our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Strategic Global Sourcing group, we saw continued performance and execution in the core distribution business, both in increasing volumes with our existing customers and supporting their growth. I'm excited and pleased to announce that our team has re-signed of our key anchor customers, Humana. We've had a long relationship with this strategic partner and this early renewal shows a mutual appreciation and strong desire to continue growing together.Consistent with our customer contract rebalancing efforts, we were able to build a long term contract that is a win-win for both partners and one that does not create a margin headwind. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our history of strategic investment and leadership in the distribution of specialty products.We have the best franchise, key customer relationships and continued support to launch our virtually all new specialty products. This quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter with 10% of greater revenue growth for this part of the business. The connection we provide between manufacturers and our physician customers enables us to best support the commercialization of specialty products, both new innovative products and new biosimilar products, and empower those physicians to best serve their patients.As a brief update on PharMEDium, I'm proud of the execution of our associates in remediating at PharMEDium's Memphis facility. You'll recall we voluntarily suspended operations in December. We've been in active communication with the FDA and two weeks ago we notified the FDA of our intent to resume limited production at the Memphis facility and commence commercial distribution this month. We expect production in Memphis to increase gradually over time and to be fully operational in fiscal 2019.",

Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another spectacular quarter, as our businesses delivered exceptional results across all key operating and financial metrics. In the quarter, double-digit sales growth was driven by another excellent quarter of organic growth. We delivered significant operating margin expansion and robust earnings growth, while again increasing our full-year earnings guidance.We generated a record level of free cash flow and announced that we deployed $565 million on two highly strategic acquisitions. And lastly, given the strength of our acquisition pipeline, we announced an increase on our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion, providing us added flexibility as we execute on our acquisition strategy. So overall, another outstanding quarter, reflecting the strength of the AMETEK business model, the differentiated nature of our businesses, and the excellent work of the entire AMETEK team.Now, on to the financial and business highlights. Total sales in the third quarter were $1.19 billion, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was again very strong at 7%, with acquisitions adding 3% and foreign currency neutral to sales in the quarter.Growth remains broad-based across our businesses, with both our reportable segments growing 7% organically. This organic growth also remains very strong and balanced geographically, with Asia growing 12%, Europe 7%, and the U.S. 6% in the quarter.EBITDA in the third quarter was $312 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2017, with EBITDA margins a very strong 26.1%.

Overall sales for EIG in the third quarter were $742 million, up 10% over the same quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 7%, with recent acquisitions contributing 4%. Foreign currency was a slight headwind to sales in the quarter.Organic growth remains broad-based across our EIG businesses. We saw very strong growth across our process businesses, including Rauland, which has experienced tremendous growth since being acquired in early 2017. Additionally, our Ultra Precision Technologies division had another outstanding quarter, with mid-teens organic sales growth.Operating income for EIG in the quarter was $190.3 million, up 17% over the prior year period. Reported operating income margins were excellent at 25.6%, up a very strong 130 basis points over last year's third quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up an outstanding 190 basis points over the same quarter of 2017.The Electromechanical Group also had an excellent quarter, with impressive sales growth and margin expansion. EMG sales in the third quarter were $450.9 million, a 9% increase over the same quarter last year. Organic sales growth was very strong, up 7% versus the prior year. The acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 2% and foreign currency had no impact on sales.

                 'AMGN': "I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.Arvind SoodExcellent. Thanks Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We have a lot of ground to cover, so I'll keep my comments brief.Continued execution, launch progress, and pipeline advancement are some key themes that come to mind as I think about our third quarter results. To elaborate on these themes and more, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO. After Bob's strategic review, our CFO David Meline will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Also joining us today is Tony Hooper, and then you'll get to hear from Murdo Gordon, our newly appointed Head of Global Commercial Operations. Following Murdo's review of product performance, our Head of R&D, David Reese will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and a link to those slides was sent separately.My customary reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.Robert BradwayOkay Arvind, thank you.On today's call I'll provide an overview of our performance in Q3, speak to the progress we're making in delivering our strategy for long-term growth, and share some thoughts on the current healthcare environment.Let me start by acknowledging that while we're in the midst of a period of high volatility driven by a variety of macro and political factors, our fundamental objectives of innovating for the benefit of patients and delivering for shareholders remain intact and unchanged.Looking to the future, there are bound to be headwinds but we're confident in our ability to navigate them from a position of strength. You see evidence of that strength reflected once again this quarter in our healthy balance sheet, strong cash flows, and efficient cost structure.We've said for some time that we expected growing pressures on drug prices in our industry. We can all see that plainly today. With price under pressure, having innovative products which can deliver volume growth by meeting the needs of large numbers of patients is ever more important.We have several such products and you can see the benefit of this in the third quarter where our new and recently launched products had double-digit unit volume growth. We believe differentiated products like Prolia, Repatha and Aimovig offer attractive long-term growth prospects.Prolia continues to build strength globally and there continues to be large untapped potential in the area of osteoporosis. With Repatha, we're taking steps to open up access and improve patient affordability to this important therapy.Our announcements this past week are significant and reflect our commitment to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients especially in Medicare in order to help ensure that patients who need Repatha get Repatha.Our new product story continues to unfold with Aimovig and migraine prevention. I'm sure it's not lost in you that Aimovig is off to a very strong start and in fact is shaping up to be one of the industry's most successful recent launches reflecting the pent-up demand that exists in this area.People suffering from migraine and their physicians have been waiting for years for an effective new therapy and they've reacted very well to Aimovig. We believe biosimilars can be an important growth driver for us as well as we’re now launching KANJINTI, a biosimilar Herceptin and AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira internationally.Our innovative pipeline is moving very quickly. As you know, we aim to allocate capital to R&D where we believe we have innovative first-in-class molecules with the potential for large effect sizes and serious diseases. Over the past few months, we've introduced seven such programs into the clinic. Dave Reese will talk more about these in a moment.From a capital allocation standpoint, we've continued with our share buyback and dividend increases and will continue to take a disciplined approach to business development where we believe we can create value for Amgen's shareholders.Turning to the political policy environment for drugs in the U.S. this obviously remains very topical we don't expect this to end anytime soon. We remain committed to working with the administration and elected officials to advanced market-based reforms that will promote competition and improve access to new therapies without undermining our nation's innovative ecosystem.The U.S. leads the world and discover new cures and treatments for serious diseases. We believe our society benefits from embracing this innovation. If our objective is to lower healthcare costs and improve population health and productivity, what we need is more innovation and not less and we need a system that ensures access to it.Let me end by thanking our staff for their efforts this past quarter. I know they're working hard to finish the year on a strong note and I'm grateful to their dedication and for their dedication or for their dedication to our mission.",
                 'APH': "I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions.As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06.Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically.Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%.From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%.This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment.Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed.The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses.Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income.From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range.The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S.",
                 'APC': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Robin Fielder. Please go ahead, ma'am.Robin H. Fielder - Anadarko Petroleum Corp.Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Anadarko's third quarter 2018 conference call.I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. However, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our SEC filings and the GAAP reconciliations located on our website and attached to yesterday's earnings release. Additionally, we have provided additional detail in our website in the second quarter operations report.And with that, I'll turn it over to Al for some opening remarks.Robert A. Walker - Anadarko Petroleum Corp.Thanks, Robin, and good morning. Happy Halloween – and no, we are not in costumes, but we did consider it.Last year at this time, we discussed with you our intent to be increasingly capital efficient in a market that was and would likely continue to be volatile for oil price discovery. We expressed our focus on allocating capital to deliver healthy growth on a per debt-adjusted share basis, with the expectation of generating significant free cash flow as the commodity outlook improved.We also believed our material, scalable asset footprint could deliver attractive returns from our oil-weighted opportunities. Taken together, this growth per debt-adjusted share producing attractive cash flow return characteristics would form the basis for our capital allocation and capital return strategy for years to come.During the third quarter, we generated almost $550 million of adjusted free cash flow, as our margins increased to their highest level in more than four years at almost $34 per barrel. Meanwhile, we delivered $625 million of cash returns to shareholders, which is 38% of our third quarter cash flow from operations, including $500 million of additional share repurchases and a dividend payout of $125 million.The improving margins continue to be supported by our commitment to increasing our liquids mix, aided by our ability to access Gulf Coast markets for our domestic crude oil production. Currently, approximately 55% of our total oil volumes benefit from waterborne pricing. And by the end of next year with the startup of the Plains Cactus II line, we expect that to increase towards 70%.Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 10% of our shares outstanding, increased our dividend by 400%, and announced plans to reduce debt by $1.5 billion. At the current strip, we expect to generate strong free cash flow during the fourth quarter and into 2019, given our continued commitment to investing our capital in a $50 oil price environment that provides healthy oil growth within this lower price cash flow assumption. We plan to use our cash and expected free cash flow to complete the remaining $500 million of our share repurchase program by the first half of 2019 while retiring an additional $1.4 billion of debt.We updated our full-year 2018 production guidance to tighten our previous range to account for the limited days left in the year as well as acknowledging that we did not need to seek significantly more oil growth over the balance of this year to achieve our annual objective. These changes also reflect the expected impact of hurricane-related downtime and previous capital allocation adjustment.We expect at this time to deliver in 2018 more than 13% oil growth, or 15% or more on a per debt-adjusted share basis, and a greater than 19% return for our cash flow on invested capital. These performance metrics were central to our investment strategy for the year.As we look ahead to 2019, we will continue to use the $50 oil price environment assumption to produce healthy multiyear double-digit oil growth, remain committed to returning capital to shareholders above this breakeven threshold, and demonstrate the durability of this investment strategy due to the strength and capital efficiency of our capital asset portfolio.Later this quarter, we will be announcing our 2019 investment plan, the timing of which will follow the November 6 midterm election and in particular the voting result in Colorado.Regardless of what happens, we feel confident we can continue to deliver our expected 2019 result given the flexibility of our portfolio. Multi-well pad and campaign-style development is beginning in the Delaware Basin, thanks to the tremendous work our teams have done to build out the necessary infrastructure and secure takeaway to facilitate future growth.",
                 'ADI': "I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.Michael LucarelliThank you, Jennifer and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be archived in the Investor section of our website.Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Our commentary about ADI's third quarter financial results will also include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude special items. When comparing our third quarter results to our historical performance special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most typically comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com.Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?Vincent RocheThanks, Mike and good morning to everyone.Analog Devices well we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment.It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long-term.In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially, in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise.Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. We also delivered very strong free cash flow generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin.ADI's cash generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal three quarters ahead of plan and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our Board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases.Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities.On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation.For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies higher quality more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This manufacturing in which cyber physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant will use additional data for decentralized decision making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a vast deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge.For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go-to-edge solution provider, the place where the data is born so to speak. And I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years.In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support.Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software.At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and SAEs. And the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and to increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come.",
                 'ANSS': "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.Annette N. Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our new and improved Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and business update, as well as our updated Q4 and fiscal year 2018 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.During this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606 unless we explicitly note that we're referring to ASC 605 results. Note that all references to growth will be in terms of ASC 605 results since we have no baseline for last year under ASC 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded in a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei?Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was yet another exceptional quarter. We exceeded the high end of our Q3 revenue and our earnings per share guidance by $8 million and $0.24 respectively. Our revenue growth as measured under ASC 605 was 12%, leading to record third quarter ASC 605 revenue and earnings per share. We recorded $762 million of deferred revenue and backlog as measured in the ASC 605, which represents a 14% year-over-year increase. Our ACV growth in constant currency was outstanding at over 13% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. This reflects strong customer demand for ANSYS solutions and our ongoing success in the market.Given our robust performance to-date in 2018 and the strength of our pipeline going into the last quarter of the year, we are increasing our revenue, our EPS, and our operating cash flow guidance for the full year. We're also raising ACV guidance at the midpoint. Maria will provide more details in a few minutes.In Q3, we recorded numerous six figure deals across several major verticals. With the race to 5G in high gear, the high-tech vertical performed well with leading communications companies choosing ANSYS in part because of the multi-physics design capabilities enabled by our Chip-Package-System workflow. Our market-leading capabilities and enabling electrification and autonomy drove customer investments across the automotive sector. The aerospace and defense sector performed well as investment is increasing in the U.S. and Europe. The industrial equipment vertical, particularly the rotating machinery market, is also benefiting from the recovery in oil and gas.In Q3, we also saw an increase in investment from the healthcare industry. We work with healthcare leaders such as Medtronic for many years on the use of in silico medicine to advance medical device design. At the September meeting of the Avicenna Alliance, a global alliance of healthcare industries and researchers that was set up at the request of the European Commission, Medtronic reported that modeling and simulation helped them release the product to market two years earlier, treating 10,000 patients during this period, and saving an estimated $10 million.From a geographic perspective, ASC 605 revenues grew double-digits in the Americas and Europe, while Asia Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. Our three largest markets, the U.S., Japan and Germany, led our performance in the quarter each with double-digit revenue growth. Our new go-to-market strategy, which we described at Investor Day last year, is seeing success. Our approach enables us to effectively grow and close large enterprise deals, while efficiently addressing the large volume of our transactional business. We're intelligently matching our customer size, location and level of simulation sophistication with our routes to market, which include the use of strategic sales teams, territory sales, indirect channel partners and inside sales reps.",
                 'ANTM': "I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management.Chris Rigg - Anthem, Inc.Good morning, and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.Gail will begin the call by giving an overview of our third quarter financial results, followed by commentary around our focus on execution and our enterprise-wide growth priorities. John will then discuss our key financial metrics in greater detail and go over our updated 2018 outlook. We will then be available for Q&A.During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com.We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and our quarterly filings with the SEC.I will now turn the call over to Gail.Gail Koziara Boudreaux - Anthem, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Anthem's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share of $3.62 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.81, reflecting improved execution across our enterprise and growing momentum within our businesses.Anthem's third quarter operating revenue grew 4% over the prior-year quarter to $23 billion. Strong growth in our Government Business more than offset the planned reduction in our Individual business. Administrative fees and other revenue increased more than 15% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting increased sales of our Specialty products, clinical engagement programs, and growth of fee-based membership. Third quarter membership met expectations, and we expect growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter.Our third quarter medical cost performance was strong and reflects the impact of our value-based integrated care arrangement. Anthem's Whole Health Connection, which delivers clinical integration across our medical and Specialty product is closing gaps in care and reducing costs. Over the last year alone, this program has helped identify over 30,000 diabetic through vision exams.Our 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook is now greater than $15.60, reflecting a 30% increase from 2017. Our revised 2018 guidance is a direct result of the enterprise-wide changes we made to improve execution, including sales force automation, the introduction of new clinical programs, and further scaling of existing assets like CareMore. We believe the investments and cultural changes we've implemented in 2018 provide a solid foundation for growth in 2019 and beyond.We're focused on creating innovative, meaningful, and cost-effective healthcare solutions for consumers. Our collaboration with Walmart, launching in January of 2019, gives our Medicare Advantage member the flexibility to use their over-the-counter plan allowances to purchase medications and health-related items from Walmart's 4,700 stores and online. Today, more than 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, and our partnership demonstrates our commitment to driving convenient, affordable access to healthcare for our seniors.Our 2019 Medicare Advantage plan design feature competitive medical and pharmacy benefits and include significant enhancements to ancillary benefits designed to address whole person care. Overall, our 2019 Medicare Advantage offering position us well for both mid-double digit growth and stable margins.As we highlighted on the second quarter earnings call, momentum in our group Medicare Advantage business is accelerating, and we now expect total membership to exceed 150,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Our success in winning business is a result of our deep penetration in the commercial market, industry-leading Blue brand, and strong consumer relationships. As the trusted brand for many of the largest commercial accounts, we benefit from a captive new business pipeline and are uniquely-positioned for multiyear growth in the group Medicare segment.We're disappointed with the Star Quality rating scores that were recently announced by CMS, which will impact payments in 2020. As part of our overall Medicare Advantage Star Strategy, we're deploying incremental capital to improve clinical quality, pharmacy and medication management, and the member experience. We believe these steps will lead to an improved Stars outcome for the 2021 payment year.",
                 'AON': "Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Please go ahead, GregGregory CaseThanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we are excited to have our Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, join the call today. As highlighted last quarter, we intend to use our time on the call to provide you with more insight into the longer term view for the firm, with greater transparency into strategic initiatives. Also, like last quarter, we posted our detailed financial presentation on our website. We believe this approach provides a more thoughtful, long-term focus towards operational performance, including examples of investment in growth areas that are strengthening our capability to serve clients. Mike and Eric will be great additions to this discussion to give you another perspective on the power of leading Aon United.With that opening, we'd like to start by noting that our colleagues around the world delivered another strong result for the third quarter, with positive performance across each of our key metrics, including: 6% organic revenue growth; 190 basis points of margin expansion; 18% operating income growth; and 34% growth in EPS; and a similar strong performance across our key metrics year-to-date, reinforcing our continued long-term momentum, which Christa will discuss a little bit more in a bit.This continued momentum is a direct result of the strategic actions we've progressively taken to build upon the idea of leading Aon United and the impact it's having at scale on our business.As discussed last quarter, we've been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability and aligning client demand through programs like Aon Client Promise, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to deliver value for clients.More recently, over the last few quarters, we've taken steps to further reinforce and amplify this progress. In doing so, we've truly entered the era of Aon United, through structural changes that break down barriers and make it easier to deliver the best of the firm to clients: a single leadership team; a single P&L; a single brand; a single operating model. Most compelling, a united global professional services firm.Just last week, we announced another reinforcing step in this journey: The formation of our New Ventures Group, a team of leaders from across the firm who've created additional capacity to build on our already industry-leading record in innovation and further accelerate new sources of value for clients, led by Tony Goland as Chief Innovation Officer. The benefits that accrue when our global firm effectively works together are distinctive and unmatched in the industry and are unlocking significant value for our clients through greater innovation and superior, tailor-made solutions that fit their specific business objectives. Let me give you 2 quick examples. The first is an example of how our strategic investment in client-serving capabilities led to connections across solution lines and geographies in our core business that created unique client value. And the second is an example of how we're expanding the marketplace by attacking new business challenges on behalf of our clients.The first example. I was recently with one of our enterprise client leaders, which is a team of business advisers that coordinates Aon's value proposition for a select group of significant clients and a large private equity client. And we were discussing the needs of their portfolio companies. And in doing so, it became clearer that they wanted to put their balance sheet to work in new ways and that they aspired to create value outside of traditional PE opportunities. Our enterprise client leader connected that aspiration to our pension de-risking capabilities, and we began a conversation about the opportunity to apply their capital to help de-risk the pension obligations of their portfolio companies and potentially, beyond that, in the broader marketplace. By doing so, we expanded the conversation from risk mitigation to value creation. This is likely to be a new source of value for the client over the coming years and was made possible by the connection our enterprise client leader made between our commercial risk solutions capabilities and related offerings in Retirement Solutions. This example also demonstrates how the enterprise client group could help us create a templated approach to value creation and that we can replicate across sectors. And more broadly, how that, that team is helping us institutionalize our approach to Aon United growth opportunities and developing best practices designed to make it easier for all of our client-facing colleagues to bring the best of our firm to clients.This second example is all about marketplace expansion, as we continue our focus on expanding the marketplace by developing solutions to our clients' most pressing business needs. In Q3, we continued to invest behind cyber, with the launch of our silent cyber solution, driven by analytics and backed by an evolving reinsurance solution to help carriers respond to expanding cyber risk and regulations.",
                 'AOS': "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.Thank you, Adam. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2018 third quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Executive Chairman; Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3.Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Here are a few comments about our third quarter. We achieved sales of $754 million, net earnings of $0.61 per share or 13% higher than our earnings per share in 2017. We continued to review our capital allocation and dedicated portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $106 million through the first nine months of the year. We plan to continue buying back our shares at a previously stated $135 million annual pace using a 10b5-1 plan. We expect to opportunistically buy back up to $65 million worth of shares in the open market in 2018.We announced a 22% increase to our dividend in October. This is the second increase this year. The five-year compounded annual growth rate of our dividend is about 30%. We repatriated nearly $300 million during the first nine months of 2018 using the proceeds to repurchase our shares and pay down floating rate debt. Our A.O. Smith-branded water treatment products are now in 1,700 Lowe's stores nationwide.John will now describe our results in more detail beginning on slide 4.John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.Sales for the third quarter of $754 million were 1% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Net earnings in the third quarter of $105 million increased 12% from the third quarter in 2017. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.61 increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North American segment of $487 million were flat compared with the third quarter of 2017. Pricing actions in 2018 on water heaters and boilers related to higher steel and freight costs were more than offset by lower water heater volumes.North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana, Hague and our recently-launched water treatment products at Lowe's, incrementally added $9 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $274 million increased 1% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales – China sales growth was 2.5% in local currency. Higher sales of water treatment products and air purifiers in China were partially offset by a decline in electric water heaters compared with the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by approximately $6 million compared with the third quarter 2017.On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $106 million were 4% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The unfavorable impact from lower sales of water heaters and higher steel and freight costs were partially offset by pricing actions. Spending associated with the launch of water treatment products at Lowe's amounted to approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, North-American segment margin of 21.7% was lower than last year.Rest of World earnings of $39 million increased nearly 16% compared with third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of lower expenses associated with employee incentive programs and smaller losses in India. As a result, third quarter segment margin of 14.3% was significantly higher than one year ago.Our corporate expenses were higher than last year as a result of several miscellaneous items. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was 20.5%. The rate was lower than the 28.8% experienced during the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes related to tax reform. The lower effective income tax rate benefited third quarter 2018 earnings by $0.06 per share.",
                 'APA': "Gary Clark, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.Good morning and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call today with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apaches Senior Vice Presidents: Brian Freed, Midstream and Marketing; Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals.Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunctions with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com.On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels.Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website.And with that, I will turn the call over to John.John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss Apache's strategic positioning, provide a preview of 2019, comment on our strong third quarter performance and review our key focus areas. Apache is a very different and much improved company from four years ago when oil prices began their prolonged downturn in the fall of 2014. We acknowledged very early on that the industry including Apache needed to make significant changes, not only in terms of reducing activity levels and overall cost structure, but equally to reestablish long-term returns discipline in the capital program.At that time, we chose to significantly curtail our drilling program, allowing production to decline rather than pursue growth in an environment where commodity prices and costs were not properly aligned. We refrained from participating in high-cost acreage acquisitions in the heart of proven plays, choosing instead to build our unconventional exploration capabilitiesAn important outcome of this strategy was the discovery of Alpine High. We have frequently stated our philosophy that an E&P company should be capable of living within cash flow from operations, generating sustainable long-term reserve and production growth while also returning capital to shareholders.After significant upfront investment at Alpine High and the pending completion of our Altus Midstream transaction, Apache has turned the corner and is well positioned to deliver on this philosophy for many years to come. We continue to generate steady production growth on a flat activity set and are poised to deliver positive free cash flow in 2019. This can be sustained over the long term through development of our extensive inventory. It will be supplemented by organic exploration, including discoveries in hand today, and a refreshed portfolio of new opportunities.Lower F&D costs, increasing returns and continual portfolio hydrating will accompany our growth and drive sustainable shareholder value growth through time. This is the investment proposition Apache offers and it is one that we strongly believe in, as evidenced by our decision to begin repurchasing shares in September under an existing authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of 40 million shares, which represents more than 10% of shares outstanding.Now I would like to provide a preview of 2019. For more than a year, Apache has operated at a relatively constant upstream activity level, which has enabled us to deliver operational efficiencies, effectively control costs and generate sustainable liquids production growth. We anticipate maintaining a similar activity level next year, but on a lower capital budget. If changes in expected cash flow dictate, we have the flexibility to reduce our activity levels accordingly.In 2019, assuming commodity prices in line with the current strip, Apache expects upstream capital investment of approximately $3 billion, which is consistent with our current guidance and is lower than 2018. Adjusted production at the high end of our 410,000 to 440,000 BOEs per day guidance range, representing more than 15% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth overall, positive free cash flow and continued return of capital to shareholders. This is well-aligned with the philosophy I outlined at the beginning of the call and we look forward to providing a more detailed 2019 outlook in February.",
                 'AIV': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Cohn, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Please go ahead, ma'am.Lisa CohnThank you. Good day. During this conference call, the forward-looking statements we make are based on management's judgment, including projections related to 2018 results and 2019 expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, a description of which can be found in our SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from what may be discussed today.We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as AFFO and FFO. These are defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's Web site.Prepared remarks today come from Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO; Keith Kimmel, Executive Vice President, in charge of Property Operations; Wes Powell, Executive Vice President, in charge of Redevelopment; and Paul Beldin, our Chief Financial Officer. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks.I'll now turn the call over to Terry Considine. Terry?Terry ConsidineThank you, Lisa, and good morning to all of you on this call. Thank you for your interest in Aimco. The apartment business is good and Aimco had another solid quarter. In fact, the strength of our summer season led Paul to increase its expectations for full year bottom line for the second time in two months.We are upbeat as we finish 2018 and optimistic that 2019 will bring further good news. As we look forward to next year, we continue to look for accretive opportunities to deploy capital, while maintaining our commitment to a safe and flexible balance sheet. For their hard work and solid results in the third quarter and for the opportunities they provide us as we look forward, I offered great things to my Aimco teammates, both here in Denver and across the country.And now for more a detailed report in the third quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel, Head of Property Operations. Keith?Keith KimmelThanks, Terry. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid third quarter in operations. We've executed a purposeful strategy focused on average daily occupancy. Third quarter finished at 96.3%, 30 basis points better than the third quarter of 2017. Our occupancy accelerated each month throughout the quarter, from 96% in July to 96.6% in September. This has further grown to 96.8% in October, which we expect to maintain throughout the fourth quarter and provide a springboard into 2019.This is driven by our low turnover of 44.8%, resulting from consistently high customer satisfaction and focused customer selection. We continue to have pure leading margins in our same-store portfolio of 73.8% for the quarter, benefiting from our consistent focus on staffing efficiencies, process centralization and automation.Turning to our same store results, revenues were up 3.1% for the quarter. Consistent with our plan, expenses were up 4.5% due to a challenging comp related to non-recurring items in 2017 and higher investment in maintenance across our portfolio. Going forward, we see continued innovation enabling us to return to a more Aimco like expense result in 2019.Finally, net operating income was up 2.6%. Locking at leases which transacted in the quarter; new lease were up 2.2%; renewals were up 4.2%; and same-store blended lease rates were up 3.2%. We saw new lease rates of 4% to 5% in Los Angeles, Boston, the Bay Area and San Diego with the most pressure on new lease rates in Miami, where we saw the impact of directly competitive new supply.Turning to the third quarter same-store revenue growth; our top performers representing more than half of our same-store portfolio, had revenue increases over 4% for the quarter; this includes Boston, San Diego, the Bay Area, Miami and Los Angeles; our lower same-store revenue growth came from Atlanta and Philadelphia, which had negative revenue growth for the quarter; these two markets represent less than 5% of our same-store revenue. Outside of same-store, our premier Philadelphia redevelopment and acquisition communities have delivered strong results; the Sterling was occupied above 95% for the quarter.Today, the first three towers at Park Towne are 95% occupied and the fourth tower is now over 80% leased. We’ve accomplished this with rents in line with our underwriting. Our four acquisition communities in Philadelphia have achieved revenue on track with underwriting. And in Washington DC, we continue to be encouraged by the performance at our Bent Tree acquisition where rents were increased $100 on day one and we’ve seen occupancy rise by more than 300 basis points, and this has resulted in both rents and occupancy ahead of our underwriting.",
                 'AAPL': "Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently-filed periodic reports on form 10-K and form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date.I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters.Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you.First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active installed base grew by double-digits, driven by switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa.Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these.Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today.The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than ever before. And based on third party research estimates, the App Store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018.The app economy is thriving and thanks to the App Store, it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next.We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service and as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples, Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communications services are experiencing record usage. We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of Messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters.",
                 'AMAT': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan. Please go ahead, sir.Michael SullivanGood afternoon. And thank you for joining us. I’m Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, let me remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied’s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management’s estimates, projections and assumptions as of August 16, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them.Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today’s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at appliedmaterials.com.And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.Gary DickersonThanks Mike. I’m pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to the same period last year and the second highest in the Company's history. Fiscal 2018 remains on track to be another record setting year for Applied Materials, and we expect each of our major businesses to deliver strong double-digit growth.In today's call, I’ll start by providing our perspective on the market environment and our business performance. Then I’ll lay out our views on the industry's future growth drivers and describe how we’re evolving our strategy to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities ahead. In aggregate, we see ongoing strength in our markets. Customers are making rational investments in new capacity resulting in well balanced supply demand dynamics. At the same time, they are aggressively pursuing their development roadmaps with healthy spending on next generation technologies. Demand for wafer fab equipment is on track to be an all-time record in 2018, and our view of 2019 remains positive, our thesis that spending in 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion remains firmly intact. The details within our 2018 forecast are consistent with the view we shared during our last call with the exception of a recent downward revision to our foundry outlook.As foundry customers optimize existing capacity, they’ve trimmed their capital spending plans for the year. They are still pushing forward with leading-edge developments, prioritizing current investment towards long lead time equipment, which is a positive leading indicator for 2019. NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year with bit supply growing slightly faster. As a result, we see spending levels flat to modestly down from last year's record levels.DRAM investments are strong, up approximately 50% year-over-year as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM for data centers. Capital investments by the leading cloud service providers continues to strengthen, up about 85% year to date compared to 2017. And in line with our prior view we also expect, logic investments to be higher this year.Stepping back and looking at the broader context, 2018 shows how the industry has fundamentally changed over the past five years. More diverse demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise markets combined with very disciplined investment has reduced cyclicality. We’re not seeing the large fluctuations in wafer fab equipment spending that we did in the past. Over the same time period, we've also driven significant changes within Applied that have resulted in a larger, less volatile and more resilient business. In semiconductor, we've gained 7 points of market share in memory since 2013, while maintaining our traditionally strong position in logic foundry. As a result, we are now very well balanced across market segments.We’ve built the strong portfolio of products that addressed major technology inflections. For example, by developing tools for next generation multi patterning, we have grown our patterning business in DRAM, logic and foundry from about $100 million in 2013 to more than $1 billion this year. We expect our patterning opportunity to grow by another billion dollars as EUV and new materials enabled patterning steps are adopted over the next five years.In display, we have scaled the business from about $600 million in 2012 to approximately $2.5 billion this year. In both TV and mobile, customers are investing in new technologies and that plays directly to Applied’s strengths. We expect display to remain a powerful growth driver for the Company over the long-term.",
                 'APTV': "I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Rosman, Aptiv’s, Vice President of Investor Relations. Elena, you may begin your conference.Elena RosmanThank you, Albert. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining Aptiv’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.To follow along with today’s presentation, our slides can be found at ir.aptiv.com. Consistent with prior calls, today’s review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv.The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for both our Q3 financials, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year are included at the back of the presentation and in the earnings press release.Please see slide two for disclosure on forward-looking statements, which reflects Aptiv’s current view of future financial performance, which may materially be different from our actual performance for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv’s President and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business and then Joe will cover the financial results on our outlook for 2018 in more detail.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.Kevin ClarkI'm going to begin by providing an overview of the third quarter. I'll highlight some of the key new customer awards and cover recent developments across the business. Joe will then take you through our detailed financial results for the third quarter as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter.Our strong third quarter results reflect our ability to consistently drive sustained outperformance. We delivered 11% revenue growth. That represents a record 13 points over market; the result of double-digit growth over market in both our Advanced Safety and User Experience, and Signal and Power Solutions segments.Operating income totaled $420 million, that's up 7%, while earnings per share reached $1.24, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Operating margins declined 40 basis points, driven by unfavorable FX rates and commodity prices. Excluding the impact of FX and commodities, margins increased 30 basis points.In the face of softening global vehicle production, achieving the revenue, operating income and earnings guidance we provided back in July reflects the strong demand for our portfolio of technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected mega trends, as well as our flexible cost structure.We believe it's prudent, given both the weakening of customer schedules that began late in the third quarter and the significant change in FX rates to adjust our financial outlook for the fourth quarter to reflect a more choppy macro environment. Joe will take you through the details in a moment, but we now expect global vehicle production to be down roughly 0.5 point for the full year.Moving to the right side of the slide, we continued our record pace of new business awards totaling almost $16 billion year-to-date, and putting us solidly on track to exceed our prior year record of over $19 billion.Our recent customer awards are at the intersection of Auto 2.0 trends. As always, look to accelerate their adoption of higher levels of advanced safety, electrification and connectivity. And as a result, we're booking new business, because we have the right software, compute and integration capabilities required to help accelerate OE adoption.Lastly, our Mobility and Services Group continues to make progress on next generation automated driving software, vehicle architecture and connected services, which are gaining commercial momentum and will be on display at CES 2019.In summary, another strong quarter, further validating that our operating model, technology portfolio and business strategy can deliver continued outperformance in any environment.On Slide 4, you can see the third quarter new business bookings totaled $4.4 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $15.6 billion. The record bookings levels are the direct result of our widening competitive mode in several advanced technologies.We booked $2.4 billion of active safety awards year-to-date, and are on track to reach over $3 billion for the full year. Year-to-date infotainment and user experience customer awards totaled $1.5 billion, already surpassing last year's levels.Our engineered components business has booked $4.7 billion of new customer awards year-to-date, including almost $750 million of high voltage connectors, contributing to the 50% [ph] growth in high voltage electrification awards year-to-date.Our continued momentum in new business bookings reinforces our outlook for continued strong revenue growth, driven by our transition to a more integrated solutions provider, creating the software and hardware foundation that enables new features and functions while optimizing the total system cost for the vehicle.Turning to segment highlights in Advanced Safety and User Experience on Slide 5. Sales were up 14%, or 15 points over market, driven by 68% growth in active safety. As we highlighted on last quarter's earnings call, we're starting to lap new infotainment program launches and are gearing up for our next generation Integrated Cockpit Controller launch in 2020.",
                 'ADM': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Victoria de la Huerga, Vice President Investor Relation (sic) [Vice President-ADM Ventures] (00:25) for Archer Daniels Midland Company.Ms. de la Huerga, you may begin.Victoria de la Huerga - Archer Daniels Midland CompanyThank you, Jack.

I will now turn the call over to Juan.Juan Ricardo Luciano - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.92, up from $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $861 million, up nearly 60% year-over-year. And our fourth quarter trailing ROIC of 8.3% is more than 200 basis points above our annual WACC.Our team continued to capitalize on robust global demand with good execution and great utilization of our global footprint. And while delivering another strong quarter, the team also did a great job advancing our strategic plan, executed on key growth projects and accelerating our Readiness efforts as we build the foundation to take our performance even higher.Looking back on some of key accomplishments, in optimizing the core, our South American origination team manages risk positions well, including the Brazilian freight situation, and is up substantially year-to-date over 2017. We continued to optimize our North American origination footprint, monetize our investment in Agrible, and as mentioned last quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Bolivian oilseeds business during the quarter.In our efforts to drive efficiencies, our operational excellence initiatives have delivered cost savings of more than $200 million on a run rate basis over the first three quarters of the year, already meeting our full year 2018 target. We will, of course, continue those efforts.In strategic expansion, our Origination business is making important investments in digital and innovation capabilities with our just announced GrainBridge joint venture and our work with other industry players to modernize the global agricultural value chain. In Oilseeds, we announced that we are acquiring certain assets of Algar Agro, particularly two crush, refining and packaging facilities in Brazil, which will further strengthen our processing presence in that important region.Our Carbohydrates Solution business is working to add industrial starch capacity to several facilities to meet market demand, and we celebrated the opening of our modernized flour mill in Enid, Oklahoma, this quarter. And in Nutrition, we completed our acquisitions of Rodelle and Protexin. We'll close on the Neovia acquisition in coming months, and opened the latest in our series of high tech customer innovation centers in Shanghai.We're also moving very quickly in advancing Readiness. Readiness is central to our strategic goals. It underpins and supports each of our pillars of our plan. We're excited about the progress we're making and the opportunities we are creating with Readiness. Around the globe, our colleagues are identifying, analyzing and now have begun executing on initiatives that are building a foundation for increasing earnings growth in the years to come. I'll be talking more about Readiness in our outlook later on this call.Now I'll turn it over to Ray to talk about the quarter.Ray G. Young - Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.92, up from the $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $861 million, up $321 million from the year-ago quarter. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC continued its upward trajectory reaching 8.3%, more than 200 basis points above our 2018 annual WACC. Thus, generating positive EVA of $546 million.The effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 15%, up slightly from the exceptionally low rate of 13% in the prior year. For the full year 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to the lower end of the 16% to 18% range that we guided earlier in the year.",
                 'ARNC': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Paul LutherThank you, Julie. Good morning and welcome to Arconic's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I’m joined by Chip Blankenship, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Chip and Ken, we will take your questions.I would like to remind you that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today’s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release and in the Appendix in today’s presentation.With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Chip.Charles BlankenshipGood morning. Thank you for joining the call.I’ll begin with an update on the strategy review and third quarter highlights, then Ken will take you through our financial results. I’ll conclude with guidance, and we will take your questions after that.As a reminder, the goal of our strategy review is to develop actions that will enhance shareholder value, streamline the portfolio, tighten our strategic focus and strengthen our financial profile. We have completed significant milestones as reported last quarter; however, we are extending the scope and duration of this activity. We now anticipate completing the strategy review in the fourth quarter.Two publicly-announced outcomes of earlier phases of the strategy review are already in motion. The sale process for the Building and Construction Systems business is well underway and has drawn robust interest. We signed an agreement to sell our Texarkana aluminum rolling mill to Ta Chen, monetizing a substantially idle facility for $300 million in cash, as well as $50 million in earn-out potential. This is one element of the GRP transformation and growth strategy that we are developing.Before Ken takes you through the financial results, I’d like to share some highlights from the third quarter. Revenue was up 9% year-over-year, 7% organically. Volume was up in each segment. Earnings per share increased by 28% year-over-year. Segment operating profit was flat overall for EP&S with engines and fasteners posting growth, offset by performance shortfalls in structures. Segment operating profit increased for both GRP and TCS.Adjusted free cash flow was $115 million, up from $41 million in 3Q the previous year. Working capital improved by eight days, ending the quarter at 54 days. Our liquidity remains strong with $1.5 billion cash on-hand and access to a total of $5.3 billion.Now, I’ll turn it over to Ken.Ken GiacobbeThank you, Chip.I will move rather quickly through the slides, so that we can get to the updated annual guidance and your questions. We’ve also included several slides in the Appendix for added transparency.Now, let’s move to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $3.5 billion, up $288 million or 9% year-over-year as aluminum prices accounted for $108 million or almost 40% of the increase. Revenue growth was driven by volume gains across all segments. All of our major markets were healthy. Organically, automotive is up 21%, aero engines is up 16% and aero defense is up 34% year-over-year.Double-digit growth in these markets was supported by solid organic growth of 7% in the commercial transportation market and 5% in the building and construction market. Organic revenue, which adjusts for aluminum prices, currency, Tennessee Packaging and the divestiture of the Latin American Extrusions business was up $233 million or 7% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The reconciliation for organic revenue can be found on Slide 15 in the Appendix. We’ve also included year-over-year market growth rates on Slide 18 in the Appendix.Excluding special items, operating income was $348 million in the third quarter, up $12 million or 4% year-over-year. The increase in operating income was driven by higher volumes across all the segments, particularly in aerospace in EP&S and automotive in GRP.The higher volumes were offset by unfavorable aero engine mix, lower aero pricing principally in our Fasteners business and unfavorable net cost savings driven by transportation cost increases. The unfavorable net cost savings include the favorable impact of a lower annual incentive compensation accrual and an unfavorable impact of higher scrap sales.Approximately 75% of the aero price reductions is with our Fasteners business. We’ve seen an increase in fastener volume and net cost savings. The net cost savings are driven by our low-cost country production strategy in Mexico, Morocco, Hungary and China.The net impact of the price, volume and net cost savings is an increase in fastener operating profit dollars and a 90-basis-point margin improvement in the third quarter versus last year. The third quarter impact of higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted operating income by only $1 million on a year-over-year basis and operating income margin by 30 basis points.",
                 'ANET': "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charles Yager, Director of Product and Investor Advocacy. Sir, you may begin.Charles Yager - Arista Networks, Inc.Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Bechtolsheim, Arista's Chairman and Chief Development Officer.This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website.During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, industry innovations, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree.Jayshree Ullal - Arista Networks, Inc.Thank you, Charles. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter of 2018 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a record Q3, once again surpassing the consensus estimates. We exceeded our guidance comfortably with a non-GAAP revenue of $563.3 million, as we grew 28.7% year-over-year, despite tough comparisons from Q3 2017. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.11, with services contribution at 13.8% of overall sales.From a geographic perspective, our customers in the Americas contributed 72% of total revenue, while the rest of our international theaters performed quite well. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins of 64.6%, exceeding our forecast due to product mix.Our top 10 customers included all five verticals. Cloud Titans contributed extremely well in Q3 and ranked as our number one vertical, followed by cloud specialized providers and enterprises tied at the number two spot; and financials and service providers tied at third place. Our new customer acquisition and million-dollar customers continues to be solid as well. And the adoption of CloudVision and FlexRoute software exceeds our expectations.We closed our first two acquisitions in Q3, both Mojo Networks for Cognitive WiFi and Metamako for low latency based in Sydney, Australia. The acquisition of Metamako plays a defining role in deepening Arista's heritage with next-generation low latency platforms. Metamako's ultra-low latency focus based on unique FPGA designs delivers 5 to 50 nanoseconds with a predictable 70 picosecond timestamping accuracy.Last month, Arista introduced the new 400-gigabit fixed switches the 7060X4 Series. This is based on the new Broadcom merchant silicon Tomahawk 3 with significant routing and buffering improvements. It includes 12.8 terabytes capacity in a single RU form factor with superior price performance, power efficiency, density and buffer memory, all supported with our proven single image EOS.EOS also brings differentiated traffic management, load-balancing and resilience, and it eases the qualification of our customers in cloud scale networks. We expect early customer trials to begin this quarter in Q4 and mainstream production in 2019.I would like to take this opportunity to invite Andy, our Chairman and Chief Development Officer, to elaborate more on the details. Andy?Andy Bechtolsheim - Arista Networks, Inc.Thanks, Jayshree. 400-gig Ethernet is the next step in the evolution of Ethernet, delivering four times better scalability and density and up to two times the price performance and power efficiency of our existing 100-gig Ethernet products. One of the great things about 400-gig E is that it really showcases our ability to rapidly bring new switch silicon to market that is fully supported by our market-leading EOS network operating system. This means that customers can deploy the latest Arista 400-gig Ethernet switches in their production networks with confidence.",

Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.Before I get into our results, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by hurricanes Florence and Michael. Our professionals now have the important task of helping our clients sort through their claims, get losses paid, and ultimately put their lives back together. And many of our own employees must do the same for themselves. I'm really honored to be part of the insurance industry, an industry which plays the lead role in repairing property, but more importantly restoring lives.Okay. Onto comments regarding our third quarter. Doug and I are going to touch on four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Number one is organic growth, number two is growing through mergers and acquisitions, number three is improving our productivity and quality and fourth maintaining our unique culture.We had an excellent quarter and, once again, the team delivered on all four of our strategic priorities. Before I dive deeper into organic pricing and mergers and acquisitions, let me give some financial highlights for the quarter. For our core brokerage and risk management segments combined, 11% growth in revenues, 5.9% all in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 67 basis points, excluding the roll-in impact of acquisitions and we completed 10 mergers in the quarter, nine in brokerage, one in risk management, totaling about $75 million of annualized revenues, a really, really fantastic quarter by the team.Let me start with our brokerage segment. Third quarter organic growth was 6.3% all-in with broad-based strength across all of our divisions globally. We did see some stronger than estimated contingents in the quarter, but even excluding those, organic was a really strong 5.9%. Let me break that down around the world.Our domestic retail PC operations had an outstanding quarter with organic of little less than 7% and, even after excluding the stronger than estimated contingents, we were up nearly 6%. Our retail PC operations in the UK and Canada each delivered organic of about 4.5%. Australia and New Zealand are really terrific quarter, up 7%. Our domestic wholesale operations posted close to 6%. And finally, our benefits business also had a strong showing this quarter, generating more than 5% organic growth. Overall, rate and exposure continue to be a modest tailwind, and these two items combined increased our organic by a little over a point in the quarter.Let me give you some more insight into the lines where we saw some movement in the quarter based on our internal data. In our U.S. retail PC business, rate and exposures flat or positive across most major lines. For example, commercial auto is up about 4%, property is up 3%, and workers' compensation is down a little less than a point. Moving to our domestic wholesale operations, a very similar story to the retail side. Property lines up 5%, casualty lines up 2%, and workers' comp down a little more than 1%.Canada is up 2.5% overall with property up 3%, and professional lines and casualty up about a point. UK retail is positive across most lines as well. Property, marine and commercial auto are off a bit over 2%, and casualty up a little less than 2%. Pricing in Australia, New Zealand remains the strongest, properties up 7% and is stronger than casualty and specialty lines, which were up 5%. So, overall, up a couple of points, down a couple of points, you've heard me say this many times before. It's essentially a stable market – one that is good for brokers, it's good for carriers and most importantly it's good for our clients.",
                 'AIZ': "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.Suzanne ShepherdThank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2018 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.We'll start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.As a reminder on May 31st, we closed the acquisition of The Warranty Group, or TWG. Beginning June 1st, net operating income and net operating income per diluted share include TWG results, the $1.2 billion of acquisition financing obtained this past March and related costs.Dividends on the preferred stock issued as part of the deal financing are an ongoing expense reflected in net operating income. In addition, starting August 1st, the mortgage solutions business is no longer included in operating results, given the sale.Some of the statements made today maybe forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.During today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.I will now turn the call over to Alan.Alan ColbergThanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone.Overall, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. This marks the first full quarter since closing our acquisition of The Warranty Group. We are pleased with performance thus far and we're starting to jointly develop new offerings to capitalize on our leading position in the global automotive market.We remain focused on completing our global integration and are on track to deliver on our commitment of $60 million policies of run rate operating synergies by the end of next year.Results for the quarter also included solid organic growth across Connected Living, Preneed, and multifamily housing. We believe this momentum will help sustain profitable growth.As we pre-announced we incurred more than $50 million of after-tax losses related to Hurricane Florence, well within the retention limit of our reinsurance program.I want to thank all of our employees who supported our policyholders in their time of need.Let me now share some recent highlights for our three business segments. They underscore our ongoing success building strong partnerships with leading brands, our focus on innovation, and customer excellence.Starting with Global Lifestyle, the segment posted solid earnings for the quarter, particularly in mobile, where new subscriber growth more than offset higher loss experience and lower trade-in volumes. Mobile revenue increased 12% as Global Protection programs launched last year continued to gain momentum. In total, we now protect more than 44 million devices worldwide. And we continue to gain traction in the mobile marketplace.Most recently, in September, we worked with Apple to launch AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss. This represents Apple's newest and most comprehensive option in its family of device protection plans available on their stores, online, and select resellers like BestBuy. The offering provides coverage for hardware service, accidental damage, theft and loss, as well as software and technical support, something we believe continues to be a growing need for consumers. This comes on the heels of several other device programs we helped launched globally in the last two years to enable our carrier and cable partners to offer access to AppleCare services. While still very early, performance has been tracking our expectations.Also on the one-year anniversary of our partnership with KDDI, we expanded our relationship by introducing an enhanced mobile device support program for all of their Apple customers in Japan. This includes four years of coverage for mechanical breakdown, accidental damage and loss and theft. We are encouraged by the success with KDDI and look forward to finding new and unique ways to serve them and their end-consumers.Global Automotive business also continues to generate strong top-line growth, with more than 47 million protected vehicles worldwide. As the industry evolves, we're making targeted investments to expand our connected car capabilities.During the quarter, we made a strategic investment in Mojio, a leading technology platform and software service provider for connected cars, as we explore digital protection and support solutions for vehicle owners and automotive partners. We are finding ways to enhance our vehicle protection offerings with real-time telematics data and remote diagnostic information. This is in addition to connecting vehicle owners and their cars with numerous on-demand services. Overall, we see opportunities to continue to scale our businesses and introduce innovative offerings around the increasingly connected lifestyle of consumers.",
                 'ATO': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Hills. Thank you, please go ahead.Jennifer HillsThank you, Brenda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slides presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com.As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 30 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris.Chris ForsytheThank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings and continuing operations of $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with $71 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the prior quarter year's third quarter.Year-to-date, earnings from continuing operations were $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share, compared with $347 million or $3.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Yeah-to-date results include a $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share non-recurring income tax benefit from Tax Reform.Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations with major drivers underlying our performance during the first half of fiscal year continuing into the third quarter. Operating income in our distribution segment decreased $50 million to about $62 million in the third quarter, largely driven by $12 million decrease in contribution margin due to the implementation of Tax Reform.Contribution margin was positively impacted by regulatory actions which provided an incremental $11 million in contribution margin in the quarter. And we continue to experience solid customer growth.Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment had a net 34,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. We also continue to add transportation customers to this system in our Kentucky/Mid-States Division. Combined, this growth added nearly $5 million in contribution margin for the quarter.Operating expenses rose approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a planned increase in pipeline integrity activities, higher volume locate costs, higher employee related cost and increased depreciation property tax expense resulting from our capital spending.We also incurred about $1.5 million in travelling expenses associated with the planned Northwest Dallas outage during the second quarter, bringing the total expenses associated with the events approximately $24 million. This particular product has been completed and we do not anticipate material future expenses associated with this event.Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment decreased by $2 million. Contribution margin increased a net $11 million, as we recognized $24 million of incremental margin from APT GRIP case completed last August and the accrual of two GRIP filings in fiscal 2018. This increase was partially offset by $8 million reduction in revenues due to the implementation of Tax Reform.Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was $13 million increase in operating expenses, as a result of higher depreciation related to increase capital expenditures and timing of planned pipeline integrity work.Consolidated capital spending for fiscal 2018 increased 34% to $1.1 billion which is in line with our expectations. 85% of our fiscal 2018 spending was focused on improving the safety and liability of our system.Based on work concluded today and plan for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2018 capital spending to approximately $1.4 billion.We've remained very active from a regulatory perspective. To date, we have completed 19 filings which add approximately $81 million in annualized operating income over fiscal 2018 and 2019 inclusive of defective Tax Reform. $71 million of this amount related to APT. And we had 9 filings pending seeking about $42 million in annualized operating income in our distribution segment.We anticipate most of these filings will be completed during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. After taking to account, the lower tax expense we are incurring the net financial impact from these regulatory outcomes is consistent therefore we're anticipating at beginning of the fiscal year.Tax Reform has been a primary focus for a regulatory team during the third quarter and we emerge from the quarter with a lot of clarity in how Tax Reform will be reflected in customer bills. In final stage we have adjusted rates reflect the lower 21% rate. In three states, we start returning the regulatory liabilities we established effective January 1st, to account the difference between for former 35% statutory rate and the current 21% statutory rate. And the three states, we start to return exits of our taxes using conventional amortization period ranged from 18 to 40 years. These periods will be treat up in future filings.",
                 'T': "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Michael J. Viola - AT&T, Inc.Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter Conference Call. As John had mentioned, I'm Mike Viola. I'm Head of Investor Relations here at AT&T. Joining me on the call today is, first, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's Chairman and CEO; John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; John Donovan, Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Communications; and John Stankey, the CEO of WarnerMedia.Randall is going to provide some opening comments, turn it over to John Stephens, who is going to cover the consolidated segment results. Also he'll provide an update on our deleveraging plans. J.D. will give a business update for the Communications segment, including comments on FirstNet and 5G. And John Stankey is going to join us for the Q&A part of the call.I'd also like to just update quickly on our upcoming analyst event. We now plan to do a video webcast, a single sell-side, buy-side meeting. It's going to be here in New York in the late afternoon of November 29. And so more details to that will come in the next few days.Finally, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement before we begin. It says that some of the comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risk and uncertainty. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.I also want to remind you that we're in the quiet period for the FCC spectrum auctions, 101 and 102, and so we can't address any questions about that today.And as always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that includes our news release, 8-K, investor briefings, and associated schedules.And so now I'd like to turn the call over to AT&T's Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson.Randall L. Stephenson - AT&T, Inc.Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I'm going to be very brief before I hand it over to John Stephens.But this year's results, everybody knows, has had a lot of noise in them. We've had a significant amount of M&A. We've had a number of accounting rule changes imposed on us. And the third quarter was obviously particularly impacted by it being the first full quarter with WarnerMedia results in it.And just to cut through the clutter, what I typically would like to do is just go straight to the cash flows. And if you look at the cash flows for the quarter, I feel really good about the results. Our cash flow from operations was $12.3 billion for the quarter. That's up 14% year over year. And when you look at free cash flow, which is the cash available to pay dividends or pay down debt, that was a very healthy $6.5 billion, which is up 17% year over year.And if you get beneath that, there's just a couple of areas that I think are worthy of pointing out. First is Mobility, and Mobility is growing. And that's significant because it's obviously our largest contributor to earnings and cash flow. And what I'd really point out is that growth is being heavily driven by our Prepaid business, which is running red-hot. And I think we're seeing Cricket truly begin to distinguish itself in the marketplace.Then also when you look at WarnerMedia, all three divisions are growing. And WarnerMedia was immediately accretive in its first full quarter to the tune of $0.05 per share.These strong cash flows have put us on track to hit our deleveraging objectives, getting to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA by year-end 2019.And John Stephens is going to go into this in more detail. But what you're going to see is that we're going to exit this year with our debt maturities over four years old that are going to be at a very comfortable level as we exit this year.And then last, we made a number of pricing moves on video. And we're getting near the end of our fiber build project, which is basically laying the foundation for stabilizing our broadband and TV business profits in 2019.So across the business we – obviously we have a lot of work to do, a lot of integration efforts going on with WarnerMedia. But I like the momentum. I feel confident that we're on track to deliver the plans that we've laid out. And as Mike pointed out, we're going to just go through the quarter today. But when we get together on November 29, we're going to give you a full blown look at our plans as we move into 2019 and beyond.So with that, that's my high-level view on the quarter. And I'm going to turn it over now to John Stephens.John J. Stephens - AT&T, Inc.Thanks, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being on the call with us this morning. Let me begin with our financial summary, which is on slide 3.As we've done in previous quarters, we'll be referring to comparable results for most of our segments on the next few slides. AT&T adopted new accounting standards this year that deal with revenue recognition, certain pension costs, and certain cash receipts on installment receivables. These changes impact our income statements and cash flows on a reported basis. So at the same time the company made a policy decision to record universal service fees and other regulatory fees on a net basis.",
                 'ADSK': "I would now like to hand the floor over to David Gennarelli, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.David GennarelliThanks, operator and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal year 2018. On the line today is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO and Scott Herren, our CFO.Today’s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2018, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance including expectations regarding our restructuring, our maintenance to subscription transition, our customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies and trends for various products, geographies and industries.We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017, our Form 10-Q for the periods ending April 30, July 31 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today’s press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during this call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today’s call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today’s press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss the financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.Andrew AnagnostThanks, Dave. I just got back two weeks ago from the largest Autodesk University in our history. There were over 10,000 design, engineering construction, manufacturing and film production professionals in attendance. And as usual, their enthusiasm for and dedication to our products is absolutely inspiring. Now, I know several of you were able to attend the event and I'm sure you felt some of the same level of excitement I did. And before we get started with the details, I want to point out that after we review our Q3 results, I'll discuss the restructuring that we announced in today’s earnings release, which now brings me to our Q3 results.I'm pleased to announce that Q3 marks our return to revenue growth and we continue to make excellent progress on our two major initiatives, completing the subscription transition and expanding beyond design with cloud based solutions for construction and manufacturing. The consistent performance we've delivered over the last several quarters increases our confidence in our ability to achieve the goals of the subscription transition.Now, here are some key outcomes of Q3 that I want to highlight. Total annualized recurring revenue or ARR grew 25% at constant currency. Recurring revenue had increased to 92% of total revenue. Approximately a third of the eligible customers are choosing to migrate to subscription with the maintenance to subscription program or M2S. We added 146,000 total subscriptions driven by 307,000 subscription plan sub additions, making the base of subscription plan sub bigger than the base of maintenance plan subs. That is a great milestone.Now, let's take a closer look at our Q3 performance. I think it's important to first note that Q3 represents our return to revenue growth. It's the first quarter where the year-over-year revenue is comparing back to our first subscription only quarter. The growth was even better than it looked if you remember that our Q3 results last year also included $38 million of licensed backlog that rolled over from the end of sale of Suites perpetual licenses in Q2 of fiscal year ’17. Normalizing for that, Q3 revenue would have gronw 14% year-over-year.The trends we're seeing in ARR are clear signals that the transition is working. Total ARR continued to accelerate powered by double digit growth in all the three major geographies. Subscription plan ARR more than doubled, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, led by product subscription. We continue to experience tremendous growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Subscription plan ARR was just shy of becoming the major component of total ARR and there is no doubt it will become the major component in Q4 as we anticipated.",
                 'ADP': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast.Before I hand the call over to Carlos, I want to give you a brief reminder about our upcoming Investor Day. The event will be held on June 12th in New York City, and we have an exciting agenda planned that will showcase our new products, and include an update on our business and transformation initiatives. We look forward to seeing you there.Moving on to the quarter, I'd like to remind you that during our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that include the impact of certain items in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the third quarter of 2017. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos.Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2018 results with reported revenue up 8% to $3.7 billion, 6% on an organic constant currency basis. We are pleased with the strong revenue growth for the quarter and we are especially pleased with our quarterly Employer Services revenue retention, which increased 170 basis points. In our PEO segment, average worksite employee growth was 9% for the quarter, slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see strong demand particularly in the down-market.Our solid 9% new business bookings growth this quarter was in line with expectations as we continue to see improving demand for our HCM solutions. Our down-market and international businesses continued to perform well, and we were also encouraged by the performance of our up-market offerings compared to a difficult third quarter in fiscal 2017. As you can see from our reported results, we continue to see broad-based progress from investments we made in our sales force, and are therefore, increasing our fiscal 2018 new business bookings guidance growth to 6% to 7% from 5% to 7%.Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.52 per share as we delivered improving adjusted EBIT performance and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Overall, our earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations and we're happy with our strong performance, which Jan will walk you through in more detail shortly.Now, I'd like to discuss our innovation efforts and how they remain at the core of our strategy. We're continuing to invest in a new breed of HCM solutions that we anticipate will address the evolving needs of millions of workers every day and we're proud to be recognized for it. Most recently, Constellation Research recognized our suite of HCM solutions as a leader in helping enterprises navigate the barriers in doing business in today's global economy. They further noted that we have turned the Innovation Corner and described ADP as an innovative next-gen HCM vendor and a leader in big data, machine learning, and user experience.Additionally, earlier this week at Facebook's F8 conference, we launched an integration with Facebook's enterprise solution, Workplace. Now, clients using ADP for HR and payroll solutions and Workplace by Facebook for employee collaboration can offer teams access to pay and time-off information within Facebook's enterprise environment through an ADP virtual assistant that utilizes chat. This application is available now in our ADP Marketplace.As we continue to invest around our core strengths, we also remain strategic in the acquisitions we make. Last quarter, we discussed Global Cash Card, an acquisition that enables us to broaden engagement with our clients' workforce with compelling flexible payments, and WorkMarket which established ADP as the first HCM provider with freelance worker management and payment functionality. These acquisitions will enable us to drive higher market share across the entire labor pool, while we help our clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with slide complementing our comments today, are available on our Website www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on quarterly earnings conference call to see this.To begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the company for their efforts that allowed us to deliver solid financial results this quarter. And as we entered the third quarter, we were pretty optimistic about our sales prospects, since we were coming off the first reasonably severe winter in the last three years. We anticipated seeing a significant acceleration in the sales of maintenance products as the harsh winter was hard on them and as the weather improved our customers would get outside and get caught up on their maintenance work.Unfortunately, we had a very cold wet spring through March and much of April. And the anticipated acceleration in maintenance category sales for much of the quarter did not materialize. Instead two of our top performing categories were wiper blades and anti-freeze, not the categories you want leading the way in the spring. Additionally, the northeastern Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern geographies did not excel as expected after the harsher winter. However, at the end of the quarter, the last two weeks when most of the country entered a dry hot weather pattern, our sales improved materially and in the geographies and the categories that we expected.While we were disappointed with our sales for the quarter, they performed in line with our expectations from week-to-week based on the weather patterns we were experiencing. And we were encouraged when our sales responded when the weather turned more favorable. We continue to be optimistic about the balance of this selling season, because we know there is significant deferred maintenance outstanding. Despite the headline sales performance, we had some encouraging results to highlight.Our commercial business growth accelerated, increasing over 7% versus last year's third quarter and our revenue per program grew nicely. As we continue to enhance many elements of our commercial program, we are encouraged to see our business improve. We have substantially enhanced our inventory availability over the past three years, and those improvements continue to strengthen our competitive positioning in the marketplace.Additionally, our commercial customers perform their work in garages, so the negative weather doesn't impact them as much as it does the DIYer. This fiscal year-to-date, we have opened just over 90 new commercial programs and expect to end the year with approximately 150 new programs. International continued to perform well for us. We still expect to grow our international store base in both countries as we see years of opportunity ahead of us. And we continue to refine and experiment with our omni-channel efforts during the quarter.",
                 'AVB': "Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investors Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.Jason Reilley - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.Thank you, Brandon, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. This attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?Timothy J. Naughton - AvalonBay Communities, Inc.Great. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q3 call. Joining me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Matt and I will provide management commentary on the slides that we posted last night and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards.Our comments this morning will focus on providing a summary of the results for the quarter, an overview of economic and apartment fundamentals, and their impact on current portfolio performance, a review of investment and portfolio management activity where we were very active this past quarter. And finally, we'll share some progress on our Columbus Circle mixed-use development.Starting now on slide 4, our highlights for the quarter include the core FFO growth of 4.1%, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our Q3 outlook. You'll note that we've increased the midpoint of our full-year 2018 outlook by $0.03 to $9 per share.Same-store revenue growth came in at 2.3% and the same-store NOI growth was 3.1% for the quarter. The midpoint of the range for same-store performance, revenues, expenses and NOI, remain unchanged from our mid-year updated outlook. You'll note, however, we did provide additional ranges for a revised same-store basket that excludes the New York JV assets, assuming that deal closes prior to the end of the year as expected.We completed $315 million in new development for the quarter at an average initial projected yield of 6.2% and have now completed $740 million at a 6.4% projected yield for the year. We also started two new communities totaling just over $200 million in Q3. And lastly, we raised $170 million of external capital through the sale of one community at an average cap rate of just under 4.5%.Turning now to slide 5 and an overview of fundamentals, I'll just go through this quickly. As all of you know, the U.S. economy is very healthy currently with the GDP growth running around 3.5%, corporate profits surging by double digits, labor markets one of the tightest we've seen so far this cycle, and the household wealth recently reaching record highs before the recent pullback in the equity markets.Turning to slide 6, the economy is being driven by both the business sector and the consumer. Strong business and consumer sentiment is translating into increased levels of capital investment and household formation, both of which are good signs for the economy in the housing market over the next few quarters.While these and most other leading indicators are still pointing up, there are some potential risks that are worth watching, including rising geopolitical tensions, the threat of trade wars, and the normalization of interest rates through continued Fed tightening. But, overall, it appears we'll have a solid macro environment in which to operate over the next few quarters.Turning to slide 7, this favorable macro environment is in turn supporting apartment fundamentals, which are showing signs of renewed strength with several drivers of rental demand turning up, including young-adult job growth, which is running above 2% again; wage growth reaching a cyclical high; and housing affordability actually hitting a cyclical low; all positive trends for apartment demand. These drivers are all further supported by demographics as the young-adult age cohort, or those under 34, is projected to experience decent growth for the next five years and not peak until 2024.Turning now to slide 8 in the supply side of the equation. It appears we're beginning to see some early signs of relief in supply, as both permits and starts have been declining in our markets for most of the year. In fact, over the last two quarters, on a seasonally adjusted basis, starts and permits are down by over 20% in the prior two quarters. This is probably mostly due to construction cost inflation that we've been talking about and it's been averaging in the high-single-digit range over the last year, with some regions like the Bay Area even reaching double-digit growth.With rent growth generally averaging 2% to 3% over last year, projected yields on prospective deals have deteriorated by 25 basis points to 50 basis points over the last year, so depending upon the market. It stands to reason then that this would begin to have an impact on new development investment, and that seems to be occurring in our markets and to some extent nationally.We've also seen a pullback in the public markets as the apartment REIT sectors cut back on development underway by roughly 35% since year-end 2016. Of course, this recent pullback and start activity in 2018 won't be felt really in terms of deliveries until 2020 or late 2019 at the earliest, as we expect new deliveries to remain elevated over the next four quarters or so, as you can see in the box in the lower right in this chart.",
                 'AVY': "Welcome to Avery Dennison's Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter Ended September 29, 2018. This call is being recorded, and will be available for replay from 12:00 PM Pacific Time today through midnight Pacific Time, October 26. To access the replay, please dial 800-633-8284 or +1-402-977-9140 for international callers. The conference ID number is 21857413.I would now like to turn the call over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.Cynthia GuentherThanks, Chris. Today, we'll discuss our preliminary unaudited third quarter results. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified, and reconciled with GAAP on Schedules A-4 to A-8 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.We remind you that during this call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today's earnings release.On the call today are Mitch Butier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.And now, I'll turn the call to Mitch.Mitch ButierThanks, Cindy, and good everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 15%, in line with our expectations, and sales were up 6% organically, with both high-value categories and emerging markets continuing to deliver above average growth.Label and Graphics Materials delivered a solid quarter. Sales grew organically by more than 6%, driven by both higher prices and volume. Emerging markets in high-value categories were once again up high single digits. LGM's margin, however, declined more than expected for the quarter, largely reflecting the lag between when we see inflation and when we can adjust pricing. I am confident that we will see meaningful margin recovery here in the fourth quarter, just as I am confident in the strength of our competitive position. We again saw evidence of this in the strong attendance in customer engagement at our industry's recent tradeshow in North America.Much of the energy in our booth focused on two key areas. The first was sustainability, specifically our products that enhance recyclability, and second, our Intelligent Labels platform, which is generating as much buzz among our converter network as it has among retailers and brand owners, which brings us to Retail Branding and Information Solutions.The team delivered, again, another strong quarter, with over 8% organic growth and significant margin expansion. The base business of RBS continued to grow at a healthy clip through ongoing share gain, and RFID grew once again by over 20% in the quarter. We continue to see strong engagement among apparel retailers and brands across all stages of the pipeline, as well as promising early-stage developments in other end markets. Our investments to sustain this growth in form of capacity additions, R&D, and business development resources are all on track. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in building out our Intelligent Label platform as we lean forward to capture this high-growth opportunity.At the same time, we are realizing the benefits from the transformation of the base business that we started just a few years ago. Combined, these catalysts are driving another year of solid growth and margin expansion in RBIS.Now, results in Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment were clearly disappointing. Sales were well below our expectations largely due to greater than expected declines in China. Over the past couple of months, Greg and I have been going through a deep-dive assessment of the IHM segment. We continue to see great opportunity here, both in terms of the market and our own performance. While we've made progress in improving our fundamentals, our pace of change has fallen short of our expectations, so in the process of making adjustments. We remain confident in our long-term strategy for IHM, and in our ability to achieve the 2021 growth and margin targets that we laid out for this business.All in all, another solid quarter. Our strategic playbook continues to work for us. We will continue to benefit from the two key catalysts that enable our consistent GDP growth over the long-term that is high-value segments and emerging markets. And we'll continue to focus on our four overarching priorities, driving outsized growth in high-value product categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, relentlessly pursuing productivity improvement, and remaining disciplined in our approach to capital management. We continue to position to company for superior value creation over the long-term, and expect to deliver our seventh consecutive year of strong top line growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth.Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.Greg LovinsThanks, Mitch, and hello everyone. As Mitch mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.45, up 15% compared to prior year and in line with our expectations. We grew sales by approximately 6% on an organic basis, as currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 1.3 points in the quarter. Currency translation also represented a roughly $0.03 headwind to EPS, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 10.7%, as the benefit of higher volume was largely offset by the impact of increased investment spending. And we realized $6 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter.",
                 'BHGE': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Phil Mueller, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Phil MuellerThank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes, A GE Company third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can be found on our website at bhge.com.As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts, and other forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and on our website at bhge.com under the Investor Relations section.With that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.Lorenzo SimonelliThank you, Phil. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call today, I will give a brief overview of our third quarter results. I will then share some perspectives on market dynamics and highlights some of our key achievements in the quarter as we are building out our market leading product companies.We are now in the second year of our journey as BHG, we are operating the company better and we are driving change in the industry with our differentiated portfolio. We are focused on commercial innovation, outcome based models and leading technology.Today, I will provide few exciting examples of our outcome based solutions. The product is a new approach to integrated well construction in oilfield services that will provide significant productivity across the value chain.The second is a new philosophy for offshore development, which introduces new technology and a productivity based approach to subsea deepwater projects. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.In the third quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders and $5.7 billion in revenue. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $377 million. We are seeing continued improvements in our shorter cycle businesses and the outlook for our longer cycle businesses is improving. Free cash flow in the quarter was $146 million. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.03 and adjusted EPS was $0.19.Now I would like to take a few moments to share our view on the markets. We are encouraged by the improved outlook on the macro environment. Overall, the North American market continues to be resilient. Drilling related activity remains stable, which bodes well for our portfolio.We see softness in frac-related completions activity as the North American pressure pumping market weakens into the fourth quarter. Outside of our minority investment and BJ services, we are not materially impacted by the current challenges in the North American pressure pumping markets.The international markets are improving and we expect them to remain strong in 2019 as customers increase spending and activity levels. In the Middle East, despite some geopolitical risk, we expect activity to continue to grow into 2019, driven by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.The offshore market is the strongest spin in many is years. Although it will remain well below prior cycle peaks, the improving tender and order activity is an encouraging sign as we look out to 2019 and beyond. While the offshore market remains competitive, our technology and flexible partnership approach are proving to be successful with customers.LNG continues to be the primary transition fuel for a number of large economies in the world. We conservatively estimated our total of 65 million tons per annum to be sanctioned by 2020. Global energy demand has remained robust through 2018.Chinese imports were up 30% and South Korea and India have both grown over 6% year-over-year. Given the strong global demand growth and current landed agents spot prices over $10 for million BTU. We are seeing more confidence from our customers to move ahead with their projects.Earlier this month, we showed a first major final investment decision since 2015 with LNG Canada sanctioning two trains totaling 14 million tons per annum. As we have previously stated, we believe this is just the start of a new significant build cycle for which our portfolio is well positioned.With that let me share some highlights of the third quarter. In Oilfield Services, the dynamics and challenges of well construction are changing. Our leadership position in well construction is driven by technology.",
                 'BLL': "I would now like to turn the conference over to John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.John A. Hayes - Ball Corp.Great. Thank you, Melody, and good morning everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's third quarter 2018 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements, including estimates related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases.If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities, as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our CFO, and Dan Fisher, our Senior Vice President and our COO of Global Beverage. I'll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss the Global Beverage packaging performance, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then we will finish up with some comments on our aerospace business as well as the outlook for our company.Let me begin by thanking those of you who came to our Investor Field Trip earlier in October. It was great spending time with many of you and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us articulate how and why Ball is uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in its global beverage can aluminum aerosol container and aerospace businesses, consistently return significant capital back to our shareholders and grow our diluted earnings per share 10% to 15% over time.For those of you who were unable to attend the field trip, the slides and transcript of the webcast briefing are available on our Investor page at ball.com under the Presentations tab.Now turning to third quarter results, momentum continues across our businesses. On an apples-to-apples basis, comparable operating earnings were up 14% year-over-year, excluding the sale of the U.S. steel food and steel aerosol businesses completed on July 31. This was despite a few headwinds that we'll get into in a moment. In addition, a higher-than-expected effective tax rate driven by currency movements, which Scott will go into in a few minutes, also impacted us.We continue to execute our strategies of achieving better value for our standard products and higher growth for our specialty products, pursuing cost-out programs, completing growth capital projects to fuel future earnings growth, and commercializing on the inherent sustainability attributes of metal packaging to provide our customers solutions versus other substrates. In addition, we've put $600 million of proceeds from the food and aerosol sale to good work, acquiring stock and paying down debt, allowing us to reach our targeted leverage levels ahead of schedule.Now moving on to segment results in the quarter, volumes in our North and Central American beverage can business were up year-over-year, driven by emerging beverage categories as well as double-digit specialty can growth, which Dan Fisher will elaborate on more.In addition, we continued to execute on our long-stated need to secure more value for the supply of our standard products. Offsetting some of this tailwind, we continue to incur out-of-pattern freight and start-up costs related to the final two lines getting up to speed in the new Goodyear, Arizona facility. Our plant optimizations in Chatsworth, California and Longview, Texas are complete with both facilities closing this past quarter.Our South American business delivered solid performance, despite the previously-disclosed transition away from ends contract and loss of certain can volumes in Brazil. This will be more pronounced during the seasonally-strong fourth quarter and normalize as we move into 2019.Our European business continues to sequentially improve on its performance through cost-out and volume growth. We completed the start-up of our new plant in Cabanillas, Spain and we announced the intention to close a one-line facility in San Martino, Italy and expand our specialty capabilities in our Nogara, Italy beverage can plant in the North.While we still have more work to do, we are seeing the margin expansion opportunity in this segment that we articulated upon the completion of the acquisition in mid-2016. In the aluminum aerosol side of our business, global volumes were up over 7% in the quarter and this business continues to operate quite well.",
                 'BAC': 'It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McIntyre. Please go ahead.Lee McIntyreGood morning. Thanks for joining this morning’s call to review our 3Q ‘18 results. By now, I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website.Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian’s comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review the details of the third quarter results. We’ll then open up for questions. For further information on our forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings.With that, take it away, Brian.Brian MoynihanThank you, Lee. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. This is another quarter in which Bank of America delivered on the core tenets of our shareholder model.On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue a little better than GDP. We grew loans in our core business on the same basis and deposits along those same lines. We managed expense as well. In fact, our expenses were down year-over-year by 2%, and we continue to manage risk well. We’ve reached decade lows in credit costs. This allowed us to grow our earnings nicely, our pretax was up 18%, and we returned virtually all those earnings to you, our shareholders. And this cap returned allowed us to reduce our share count by over 5% year-over-year and grow EPS faster than earnings.So, beginning on slide two. During the third quarter, our 200,000 plus teammates did a great job for you, our shareholders. They drove $9 billion of pretax earnings. This is a highest quarter in the Company’s history. And we grew pretax by 18% over the third quarter of 2017.Our operating model continues to deliver. In each of the past 11 quarters, we have grown pretax earnings compared to the year ago period and done so by an average of 15%. We are in operating environment that has a strong growing U.S. economy, low unemployment, growing wage growth and strong consumer spending levels. Client engagement, optimism, and activity remains good.For the quarter, net income was $7.2 billion after tax, an increase of 32% over last year. EPS was $0.66, up 43%. Our return on tangible common equity was 15.5%, improving 450 basis points over last year. Our return on assets reached 1.23% this quarter. Driving that year-over-year improvement was 4% revenue growth. Net interest income led the way here with 6% growth year-over-year. The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is going to take through the details on that later.Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remained very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year-to-date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period. $6.5 billion of that $19 billion of year-to-date return came this quarter.On a diluted basis, average shares declined 5% from last year. We now reduced our average diluted shares by $1.4 billion from their peak and outstanding shares fell below a $10 billion market quarter, which is below the level we started at with this management team in 2010.The team’s continued to demonstrate good organic responsible growth this quarter. Year-over-year, we grew loans and average by more than 3% across the business segments. Our commercial loan growth as you’ve seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash. They continue to make good money and they also have cash they are repatriating. And lastly, they continue to benefit from tax savings and they’re using that to keep their debt levels in check.We believe this liquidity position should change as the economy continues to grow and expand as the need for capital expenditure continues to rise. In addition, we grew deposits on average 4%, year-over-year. This marks the 12th straight quarter we have grown average deposits by $40 billion on a year-over-year basis. This growth illustrates our strong competitive position. Of the $40 billion consumer checking contributed $25 billion in those balance growth as they grew over 8% year-over-year.The $350 billion of those checking balances have grown every quarter since 2012; they were up 9% on a compounded growth rate since that time. In addition, Global Banking deposits grew nicely as well and wealth management continued to stabilize. We grew credit cards and checking accounts. We broke the $200 billion asset mark in Merrill Edge online brokerage platform. We have now doubled those assets twice in the past eight years with plenty of room ahead for future growth.Overall, our client balances within our wealth management business, the best business there is in the world, exceeded $2.8 trillion. Annualized net household growth, Merrill Lynch is up nearly 4 times from last year’s advisors with more accounts. In addition, we grew small business clients and balances. Small business originations, key to supporting those communities we serve, this quarter were up over $2 billion -- were $2 billion, up 9% from last year. And we continue to acquire new commercial banking clients. So, we’re optimistic as we continue to add more customers and deepen existing relationships.With respect to credit risk, hereto we maintained our strong credit culture, and yes, we grew responsibly. Net charge-offs and ratios declined from second quarter levels as did nearly every key asset quality metric. Many factors in addition to our disciplined underwriting standards continue to contribute to success here.Our costs, with expense this quarter at $13.07 billion, our trailing four quarters expense equaled $53.5 billion. We achieved this run rate while making investments for shared success, the name we have for our tax reform grants of cash and stock to over 90% of our employees, increased investments in technology, increased investments in infrastructure, increased investments in relationship managers and physical plant. Since we declared in the second quarter 2016 that we would see a 53 billionish run rate in 2018, we have now achieved it. At first, some of you were skeptical of that but we’re here. And I have some good news, we’ll stay here. As we developed our plans for 2019 and 2020, we reaffirmed that expenses will continue to be in line with the trailing four quarter $53.5 billion number. It takes great discipline and strong execution by our teammates. Our team’s ability to invest heavily while driving expense improvements has attributed to this innovation and discipline. This discipline combined with great customer work produces operating leverage.',

Before asking Mike to walk you through the financials let me frame the quarter with some thoughts on how our businesses are performing. In terms of the headline numbers earnings per share of a $1.06 was up 13% from last year's third quarter. These results included two significant items approximately $0.05 from litigation charges and a $0.05 benefit in our tax line. Year-over-year revenue grew 1%. Expenses grew 3% though 2% of that was related to litigation and we continue to benefit from reduction in our tax rate related to the new tax law in the U.S. and from strong capital return. While we are not pleased with our total revenue growth for this quarter there are some areas with modest strengths and others that are weaker several of which we believe will strengthen over the time. Our investment services revenue growth was 3% and investment management revenue growth is 2%. These were partially offset by lower revenue in the other segments. Mike will cover that later.As I said since joining the company we're not satisfied with our growth. As we've been too reliant historically on the impact of the markets, our focus on organic growth will take time to show up in the revenue line across our businesses and though small there continue to be signs of positive momentum in some areas which we'll cover. With the reality that it will take time to see the impact of our growth activities show up in the revenue growth line, we are disciplined on expenses and will continue to be. Though our expenses increased 3% I mentioned that 2% of the increased related to litigation. So excluding litigation charges we at minimal expense growth. You also know that we've been significantly increasing our investment in technology and infrastructure to get to minimal expense growth all other expenses in total were lower than the prior year. I will discuss this a little more later but we will continue to focus on improving our structural operating leverage while continuing to invest for growth.Looking at our businesses let me first start with asset servicing. Asset servicing revenue growth is 3% and we had a reasonable fee that interest revenue and FX growth. We again saw steady performance in our core custody, middle office and fund accounting revenues on-boarding more than $450 billion of AUCA across a number of investment managers and other clients. Additionally, we have a mandate to provide middle office outsourcing for significant private credit manager where we're investing in new capabilities.Securities lending benefited from the increased demand for highly liquid assets primarily U.S. treasuries and we're benefiting from new clients and expanded business with existing clients and our growth in client driven foreign exchange revenue was driven by new business wins, higher session range volumes and market spreads. Our global pipeline remains strong across all major assets servicing products. As asset managers continue to look for ways to reduce their costs we're seeing increasing consolidation of global operations and technology which is driving demand for outsourcing managed services and data management solutions. In Pershing while we saw a reduction in revenue last quarter from two previously disclosed client losses our total revenues were flat to last quarter and up 3% from the prior year.So this means growth is offsetting these losses. As a reminder we've been awarded multiple mandates that will begin to positively impact results starting in the second half of next year and more significantly into 2020. Timing aside we're confident as ever in our ability to continue to build Pershing over the long term.",
                 'BAX': "I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.Clare Trachtman - Baxter International, Inc.Thanks, Candace. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer; and Brik Eyre, President, Americas.On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2018 financial results along with our updated financial outlook for 2018. A supplemental presentation to complement this morning's discussion can be accessed on our website. This presentation, along with related non-GAAP reconciliations, can be accessed on Baxter's external website in the Investors section under Events & News.With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product development, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And, of course, our actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more details concerning factors that could actual results to differ materially.In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth with adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for cyclophosphamide in the U.S. and approximately one month of sales from the acquisition of Claris in July 2017, along with our acquisition of two surgical products from Mallinckrodt in the first quarter of 2018.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?José E. Almeida - Baxter International, Inc.Thank you and good morning. I will begin with some comments and perspective on our third quarter results. Jay will then walk through the financials and guidance in greater detail and we will close with your questions. Brik Eyre, whom may you know from our many investor conferences, will join us for the Q&A to provide additional insights on our U.S. performance.Baxter reported solid third quarter with sales up 2% on a reported basis, 3% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, increasing 25% year-over-year. Our strong earnings growth demonstrates the continued power of our operational improvement initiatives, and we see more potential for these efforts moving forward.Drivers of growth in the quarter included the company's Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, Advanced Surgery and Acute Therapies businesses; increased demand for Baxter's contract manufacturing services also contributed to the performance in the quarter. This strength helped offset declines in our Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses.Growth in Renal Care was primarily driven by increased patient volumes for our peritoneal dialysis products globally. In the U.S. this contributed double-digit PD therapy growth. In Asia Pacific we continue to see strong patient growth in China. And for the first time in years, we're experiencing positive patient growth in Japan following the launch of Kaguya earlier this year.In Pharmaceuticals, growth was driven by strength in the U.S. where we've experienced increased demand for our premixed injectables and extended our portfolio with addition of Claris products. Claris, which we'll now refer to as Baxter Ahmedabad, continues to deliver double-digit performance growth in line with our expectations.Increased sales of anesthesia and critical care products also contribute to the results in the quarter. Advanced Surgery achieved double-digit growth including a contribution of $14 million from sales of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK.Acute Therapies also reported double-digit sales growth based on global strength across the portfolio. On Monday, this team initiated a worldwide launch of the leading-edge PrisMax system, beginning with 19 European countries.PrisMax is our next-generation technology for CRRT or continuous renal replacement therapy in organ support therapies. It offers ICU practitioners a broad range of advantages designed to make therapies simpler, safer, more accurate and more efficient. This is transformative innovation that builds on decades of Baxter market leadership in the acute care space.The strong results posted by this business was partially offset by performance in our U.S. Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses, which were frankly disappointing. I can assure you that steps are already being taken to address these issues.It starts with decisive actions to put the right leadership in place, accountable for renewing the strategic momentum and forecast reliability that we and you expect. Overall, we remain on sound footing across a vast portfolio of products with market leadership positions. To be certain, we are in a period of course correction in a few key areas which we often occurs from time to time in a dynamic market like ours.",
                 'BBT': 'It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Alan Greer, of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation. Please go ahead.Alan GreerThank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. On today’s call, we have Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the third quarter and provide some thoughts for the fourth quarter. We also have Chris Henson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer, to participate in the Q&A session. We will be referencing a slide presentation during the call.A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the BB&T website. Let me remind you that BB&T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts. However, there may be statements made on the course of this call that express management’s intentions, beliefs or expectations.BB&T’s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information in our presentation and our SEC filings. Please also note that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP disclosures. Please refer to Page 2 in the appendix of the presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.And now, I’ll turn it over to Kelly.Kelly KingThank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and thank you very much for joining our call. Hope you’re having a great morning so far. We had a great quarter with record earnings driven by strong revenue, broad-based loan growth and solid expense control. Now – for now, we continue to execute on numerous strategies, which are creating more diversified and resilient profitability. And at the same time, we are investing substantially in our digital platform, which creates outstanding client experience.Net income was a record $789 million, up 32% versus third quarter 2017. Net income, excluding merger-related restructuring charges, was a record $802 million. Very pleased that quarterly fully tax equivalent revenue was $3 billion, up 7.1% annualized compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to Regions Insurance, net interest income and investment banking.Our diluted EPS was a record $1.01, up 36.5% versus the third quarter 2017 and adjusted EPS was also a record at $1.03, up 32% versus third quarter 2017. We had really strong returns with adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE at 1.52%, 11.88% and 20.33%, respectively. More importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on a linked- and like-quarter basis, a very strong operating performance.Loans held for investments averaged $146.2 billion, which was up a strong 5.8% annualized. Margin on a net and core basis improved, with net margin improving two basis points, core margin improving three basis points, and Daryl will give you more color on that. Adjusted efficiency ratio was slightly down, and grooved at 57.3%. Adjusted non-interest expense has totalled $1.7 billion, which was up 1.5% versus third quarter 2017. However, if you exclude Regions Insurance, our expenses would have been actually down slightly.So we’re exhibiting excellent expense discipline, even recognizing that we’re making substantial investments in building what I call the new bank or the digital bank. So we are controlling expenses very, very well. Credit quality was excellent, and Clarke will give you some detail on that in the Q&A. We did increase our quarterly dividend 8% to $0.405 per share. We completed our acquisition of Regions Insurance, and that was a giant add from both a cultural and a market perspective point of view. And by the way, the execution on that has gone extraordinarily well, and Chris can give you detail on that on Q&A and we did complete $200 million in share repurchases.If you’re following along the deck, on Page 4, you’ll see that we did have merger-related and restructuring charges of $18 million pre-tax; $13 million after tax and that impacted EPS negatively by $0.02 per share. Looking at Page 5, in terms of loans, I think it was a very good loan quarter. Our average loans held for investment grew 5.8% annualized, as I mentioned a minute ago. C&I was up 2.3%, but a broad base of very strong performance in that space. Premium finance, Corporate Banking, dealer floor plan, mortgage warehouse all had strong performances. Our leasing portfolio was up 16.8%, which is very strong.Overall, retail was a very strong 11.3%, led by residential mortgage in some high-yielding, high-quality mortgage portfolios. Our acquisitions that we are holding, 16.6%. Direct was off a little bit, but that is turning, and we still feel very good in terms of the direction of that. And our indirect performance was outstanding, with strong performances in Regional Acceptance and in Sheffield. So overall, loans are performing very, very well in a good economy but not an easy economy.',
                 'BDX': "Hello, and welcome to BD's Third Fiscal Quarter 2018 Earnings Call.And beginning today's call is Ms. Monique Dolecki, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Dolecki, you may begin your conference.Monique N. Dolecki - Becton, Dickinson & Co.Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.As previously disclosed in April 2018, the company divested its remaining interest in the Vyaire Medical joint venture. The company received gross cash proceeds of approximately $435 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $308 million.In addition, in the third quarter the company recorded an $81 million non-cash charge to write down the carrying value of intangible assets related to the retiring of the BD CLiC system within our Biosciences business.We have redeployed select resources within our Biosciences business to allow us to better focus our genomic strategy on continued innovation and immunology research. These items, along with the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments, can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.As a reminder, our third quarter P&L results reflect the new BD, which includes the results of C.R. Bard for the full quarter. To provide additional revenue visibility into the new BD, we will speak to our revenue results and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance on a comparable currency neutral basis. The comparable basis includes BD and Bard in the current and prior year periods and excludes the revenues associated with our soft tissue core needle biopsy and Aspira drainage product lines that were divested in February.Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, President; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince.Vincent A. Forlenza - Becton, Dickinson & Co.Thank you, Monique, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4. At BD, our strategy is driven by our purpose: Advancing the world of health. As we stated in our press release, our strong performance this quarter demonstrates that our strategy is working.As I take a step back, I'm extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do so far. This is our second quarter together with Bard. And not only are we delivering on our financial commitments, but we have also demonstrated how nimble we can be as an organization, while executing concurrently on two transformational acquisitions.Our core remains strong, and we are getting positive customer feedback and traction with our expanded portfolio and complete solutions, further solidifying our leadership position in Medtech. As I look ahead, I'm increasingly confident that we will continue to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers.Turning now to slide 5 and our third quarter highlights. We're very pleased with our continued strong performance as the new BD. In our third fiscal quarter – our second quarter as a combined company – revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit performance across the Medical, Life Sciences, and Interventional segments. As we expected, third quarter margins were strong. Margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies.We're also pleased with the progress the integration teams are making. In June, we brought together the new BD leadership team for our strategic planning process. And it was exciting to see our organizations come together as one to discuss our innovation agenda and how our combined solutions can make an even bigger difference in the lives of patients around the world.Our executive team includes a diverse mix of leaders from both legacy organizations, as well as the broader Medtech and Pharma industry.Yesterday, we appointed Simon Campion as President of our Interventional segment, effective September 4. Simon is a proven leader with deep global experience, a demonstrated focus on results, and unique insight and breadth across the industry and the Interventional segment, having been part of three of the four legacy Bard businesses.For the past five years, Simon has led the Surgery business, formally the Davol division, and we're confident he's well-suited to drive the segment's innovation agenda and ensure we deliver our integration related revenue and cost synergies.",
                 'BBY': "I'll now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie, please go ahead.Mollie O'Brien - Best Buy Co., Inc.Good morning, and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO.This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available in the Investors section of our website, investors.bestbuy.com.Today's earnings release and conference call also includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K, for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.I will now turn the call over to Hubert.Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.Thank you, Mollie and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance, briefly discuss holiday and then review some of the progress we're making against our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.So today, we are reporting strong top and bottom line results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew Enterprise revenue 4.2% to $9.32 billion, which is a 4.4% Enterprise comp, and we increased earnings per share 30% to $0.78 compared to $0.60 last year.These results include the negative impact of 2 significant factors. First, despite what we characterize as moderate expectations for mobile phone launches in the quarter, revenue in the mobile category was materially lower than expected. This was due to the fact that a major new phone did not start selling until November, which is the first month of our fourth quarter. This resulted in significant softness in sales of existing mobile phone models in October as customers delayed their purchases. The related revenue impact in the quarter was more than $100 million.Second, like most retailers, we felt the impact of the natural disasters in South Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our first priority during these disasters was, of course, the safety and well-being of our associates in the affected communities, and we're happy to share that all of our associates are safe even though some of them suffered material losses. We estimate the negative impact to our Enterprise comparable sales was 15 basis points to 20 basis points, and that with the related costs, including insurance, deductibles, repairs and employee-related pay, our earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $0.03.Now despite these two factors, the results we are announcing today are within the earnings guidance we shared in August and are strong in absolute terms. Earlier this year, we announced the launch of our growth strategy, Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue. And well, we're growing. In fact, year-to-date, our revenue growth rate is 3%. This is materially above what we had guided at the beginning of the year.Technology innovation is fueling demand, and our strategy is resonating with our customers. And while we are investing in key initiatives and capabilities, we're also able to generate significant returns for our shareholders through the growth of our EPS and our capital allocation strategy.As such, I want to thank all of our associates for their great work in delivering these results. I am incredibly proud of the collective and individual talent, the heart and the soul of this organization.Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for holiday. Our teams across all functions are ready and keen to take care of our customers online, in our stores or in the customer's home. We have a curated assortment of great new products across multiple categories, including smart home, phones, gaming and tech toys. We have a compelling promotional calendar with strong brand messaging. We are, again, this year, offering free shipping with no minimum, and we're offering a range of new capabilities, including our new In-Home Advisor program now available nationwide, an updated gift center and same-day shipping in 40 cities.",
                 'BIIB': "Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Calistri, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.Matt CalistriThank, Dan. Thank you. And welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the Risk Factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Michael Ehlers, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Jeff Capello. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.Before I conclude, I would also like to remind everyone, that we now post releases related to earnings call and Investor Events on the Investors section of Biogen's website, www.biogen.com. And issue statement on Twitter when they become available. We do this instead of publishing earnings releases and any releases related to Investor Events and earnings calls via Newswire services. Our Twitter handle is @biogen.Now, I’ll turn the call over to Michel.Michel VounatsosGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.First, let me begin with some financial highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, Biogen's third quarter revenues grew 12% to $3.4 billion, third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 24% to $7.15 and non-GAAP EPS grew 17% to $7.40. We are pleased with this year-over-year double-digit topline and bottom line growth, as we continue to execute on our strategy to solidify our long-term leadership position in neuroscience.Now let me review the accomplishments we delivered in the third quarter. First, our MS core business including OCREVUS royalties remained stable versus prior year and delivered revenues of $2.3 billion. The number of patients on our MS products globally also remained relatively stable versus the prior year.In the U.S. we saw increasing trends for both TECFIDERA and TYSABRI on a year-over-year basis. Outside the U.S., we continued to add patients across multiple geographies.Second, SPINRAZA global revenues grew to $468 million, driven by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. and even greater revenue growth outside the U.S. The number of commercial patients on SPINRAZA increased by approximately 20% from last quarter and we now have close to 6,000 patients on SPINRAZA, including the expanded access program and clinical trials.In the U.S., we continued making progress with adults. In the third quarter more then 50% of new starts were adults, increasing the number of adult populated patients on SPINRAZA by more then 20% compared to last quarter.Outside the U.S., the pace of reimbursement for SPINRAZA across multiple geographies lead to meaningful revenue growth with significant revenue contribution not just from Europe, but also from Asia-Pac and Latin America. We have received regulatory approval in five more countries and we have made two more regulatory filings. We also secured formal reimbursement in four additional countries, including Canada and now have formal reimbursement in 28 markets.We were very proud to announce new data from the NURTURE study of SPINRAZA of the 25 presymptomatic infants with genetically diagnosed SMA that was treated with SPINRAZA, many were achieving milestones consistent with normal development. All the patients were alive without ventilation and able to sit without support. 22 patients or 88% were able to walk either with assistance or independently and 88% was normal bullbar function.We believe the long-term data we are generating across a broad patient populations underscore the compelling efficacy profile of SPINRAZA. This is the kind of innovation and progress that inspires us to tackle some of the most difficult and challenging disease areas within neuroscience.Third, we continue to develop our neuroscience pipeline as we look to prioritize our investments towards areas with highest probability of success, while building depth in core areas of expertise.Within MS and neuroimmunology we are working to expand our long-term leadership position, and this quarter we completed enrolment of the Phase 2 trial of Opicinumab, a potential remyelination therapy.",
                 'BLK': "Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.Christopher J. MeadeThank you. Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock’s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.Gary S. ShedlinThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1.During our second quarter earnings call, we noted that clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pickup in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continued trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets, and a steepening yield curve.Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives, and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future.BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms.Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year-ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group, and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment.Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movement and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by a higher day count in the third quarter.Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis point sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continue to underperform developed markets. While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging markets exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period.As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that once again delivered exceptional full-year performance and locks annually in the third quarter.",

Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us.We're off to a strong start to the tax season and I am very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on our long term strategy work; next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we're seeing in the industry, followed by our mid-season results, then we'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season and finally Tony will review our third quarter financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.First let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on our Q2 earnings call in December, we're talking a fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that I challenged the team to go deeper than we had in the past and to think differently about our business and their delivery.This work will allow us to make informed decisions about ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.Turning to the overall industry performance, the latest result from the IRS show decline in returns of 0.4% on a day-to-day basis till February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in years prior, as it is typical to see year-over-year declines on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season.Consistent with prior years, industry results till February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods, so the shift in the early season is typically greater and then moderates in the second half. Last year the season ended within an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years.At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year. Based on the early season results, we continue to expect total federal fillings to increase approximately 1% this tax season with industry assisted volumes flat to slightly up than the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.Turning to our performance, our goal for the season was to build our momentum for last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on three areas; one, improving operational excellence, two, new products and partnerships and three, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.In the Assisted business, we outpace the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in three federal 1040EZ. This is the second year for these two promotions, which attract new clients and help us improve retention.Refund Advance is an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early season filers who face delays in receiving their refunds due to the tax act. This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance with multiple tax prep providers including H&R Block offering larger loan than in previous years.",
                 'BA': "At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Co. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.Maurita B. Sutedja - The Boeing Co.Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance & Strategy.After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We have provided detailed financial information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at boeing.com.Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the presentation.In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.Dennis A. Muilenburg - The Boeing Co.Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our third quarter operating performance, followed by an update of the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.Now let's move to slide 2. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our teams across the company, Boeing delivered third quarter 2018 financial results that include higher revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow, driven by solid execution across the company.During the quarter we generated $4.6 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock. We also paid $1 billion in dividends, reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year. We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders while investing in our people, innovation, and future growth.Revenue in the third quarter was $25.1 billion, reflecting higher services and defense contract volume. Core earnings per share of $3.58 was driven by strong Commercial Airplane performance and a lower tax rate, primarily related to federal income tax audit settlements, partially offset by charges related to planned investments in the newly-awarded T-X Trainer and MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and cost growth on the KC-46 Tanker.For the full year, we are raising guidance for revenue and earnings per share and reaffirming operating cash flow. We're also raising BCA segment operating margin while reducing BDS margin guidance. Greg will discuss these in more detail in his section.With that, let's take a look at Commercial Airplanes. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $15.3 billion, reflecting 190 deliveries, with operating margins of 13.2%. Continued healthy sales activities contributed to 171 net new airplane orders worth $13 billion during the quarter, adding to our robust backlog that stands at more than 5,800 airplanes and is worth $413 billion.Year-to-date we have captured more than 630 net new orders. The 737 program continues to make good progress on its recovery plans to overcome supply chain challenges with 61 aircraft delivered in September, an improvement from July and August. In the third quarter we delivered 138 737s. We expect to recover the 737 line by the end of the year with fourth quarter deliveries expected to be above the production rate. The MAX production ramp-up continues. To-date we have delivered 219 MAXs, 57 of them in the quarter. We continue to expect MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of total 737 deliveries in 2018.The 787 program further matured its rate readiness for 14-per-month next year. The program's ongoing quality and productivity strides helped to position us for a successful ramp-up. We continued to see improvements in first-pass quality and champion times being set across-the-board.As for the 777X program, in the quarter we completed the static test airplane and moved it into test set up. We have also started building flight test airplanes on the low-rate initial production line in the main factory. We plan to start flight testing in 2019 and remain on track for the first 777X delivery in 2020.Now, over to Defense, Space & Security. BDS reported third quarter revenue of $5.7 billion reflecting higher volume across its business, including government satellites, Tanker, F-18, and weapons. Operating margins were negative 4.3% primarily due to charges related to planned investments in the T-X and the MQ-25 programs which I will touch on shortly.BDS booked $12 billion of new orders during the quarter, demonstrating the value we bring to our customers across our Defense, Space & Security portfolio. Those orders include wins on important future franchise opportunities. The T-X Trainer, the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft and the MH-139 helicopter. We also received the fourth KC-46 Tanker production lot for 18 additional Tankers in the quarter.T-X is the Next Generation trainer providing the U.S. Air Force with advanced training capabilities to replace the T-38C Talon. We anticipate the T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century. Beyond the current U.S. Air Force contract, with potential global market opportunities for both trainer and light attack platforms of up to 2,600 aircraft plus ground-based trainers and advanced simulation technologies, representing a $40 billion multi-decade platform and services opportunity.The MQ-25 is the U.S. Navy's first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Unmanned aircraft systems are proving critical in every aspect of air combat with MQ-25 autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies, applicable to a market opportunity of greater than $20 billion, for more than 200 production and derivative aircraft. The MQ-25 and T-X wins are the culmination of years of unwavering focus improving our technology and de-risking the programs. We have developed and flight tested two all-new production-ready T-X jets with 71 flight tests having been completed to-date. We've demonstrated deck handling and engine trials on MQ-25 and we currently have an MQ-25 prototype aircraft in ground testing that is being prepared for first flight.",
                 'BKNG': "A copy of Booking Holdings' earnings press release, together with an accompanying financial and statistical supplement, is available in the For Investors section of Booking Holdings' website, www.bookingholdings.com.And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen.Glenn FogelThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.We had solid execution in our busiest quarter of the year and passed a new milestone of 200 million room nights booked in a single quarter, reporting 201 million worldwide room nights booked. This is up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range.Consolidated gross bookings were up 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 14% on a constant currency basis. Our revenue increased 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 13% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew 8% in U.S. dollars with a similar currency impact on the year-over-year growth rate.Our strong room night growth rate was helped by our later-than-normal summer booking system. In addition, we have higher growth coming from our performance marketing channels, which benefited in part from our lapping the start of last year's optimization efforts.Our guidance for Q4 room night growth of 12% reflects our expectation that we will have more stability in our top line growth rate and reflects the continuation of our marketing spend. And we note that we continue to grow significantly faster than the overall global accommodations market.I am pleased with this strategic approach we have taken with our paid channels this year. Going forward, we expect these markets will remain very dynamic, which is why we'll continue to employ our data-driven approach to achieve the right balance of growth and acceptable ROIs.We will look to spend in the paid channels when we see opportunities to acquire high-quality traffic at attractive ROIs. And as I said before and want to emphasize, we work closely with those advertising partners that help us build our brand and maintain our competitive strengths while working in a manner that is best for our customers. Conversely, we will reduce our participation with those who do not work in a way that we believe best serves our customers.As you can see in our results, we're beginning to ramp up our brand advertising. As we've discussed in the past, we expect to increase our brand advertising efforts to further our goal of bringing more customers directly to our platforms and to increase product awareness, particularly in our home segment.We are increasing our spend in digital channels as they provide efficient reach and allow us to better measure the effectiveness of our spend. This is part of our long-term strategy. And though we expect to increase our investment in this area, we are mindful to spend as efficiently as possible, letting results and data help direct the pace of the investment.We have progressed in many of the investment areas that we have discussed over the current year. In particular, we've expanded our product breadth and customer experience in the areas of alternative accommodations and experiences. We continue to build supply in alternative accommodations.And as of September 30, Booking.com had over 5.7 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, which is an increase of 21% year-over-year. Booking.com's total reported listings were about 29 million of September 30.Our room night growth in alternative accommodation remains robust and is higher than our consolidated growth rate. We're also pleased to see that the number of customers whose first-ever booking with us through our home product is growing nicely.We have developed new services specifically for our booking home host. These services include streamlined property onboarding, enhanced guest management tools and property profiling capabilities, which allows host to highlight their property's unique aspects. We believe we are building a leading platform to search and discover truly unique accommodations in the same frictionless path that our customers have come to expect from us.And we continue to believe that the best customer benefit comes from offering both hotel and home accommodations on one unified platform. We recognize that building a great home platform is only part of the challenge to building a great home business.",
                 'BWA': "I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Our actual results may differ significantly for the matters discussed today. During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When you hear us say, on a comparable basis that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A, and other non-comparable items. When you hear us say, on an adjusted basis that means excluding non-comparable items. When you hear us say, on a reported basis that means U.S. GAAP.Now, on to today's call. First, Fréd Lissalde, our President and CEO, will comment on the industry, followed by a high-level overview of our Q3 results and full year outlook. He will then discuss the most recent product wins and highlights the most recent Investor Day. Then, Ron Hundzinski, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the details of our results as well as our guidance. Please note that we've posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. You'll find the link in the Events & Presentations section, beneath the notice for this call. We encourage you to follow along during our discussion.With that, I'll turn it over to Fréd.Frédéric Lissalde - BorgWarner, Inc.Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results from Q3 and update you on our progress towards delivering our full year targets. I'll start by sharing a few thoughts on the macroenvironment and the industry as shown on slide 6. Overall, I'm very proud to say that our growth over market was slightly stronger than we expected, while at the same time, global light vehicle production was much weaker.Let me first make a few remarks about the industry in Q3. Global light vehicle production came in down about 3% versus our expectation of more than 2% growth going into the quarter. This is a 500 basis points headwind versus our expectation. European light vehicle production was down 6% year-over-year as our customers continue to work through WLTP certification. Diesel/gas mix in Europe continues to shift. The diesel share declines by approximately 800 basis points year-over-year in Q3. Moving to China, light vehicle production was down 4% year-over-year which was 700 basis points weaker than our expectations. North American light vehicle production increased 2% year-over-year and growth in our commercial vehicle business was about a 50 basis points top line benefit year-over-year.Moving to the industry for full year, our expectations are consistent with what we provided last month. This implies a slightly declining global production adjusted for our geographic exposure. Looking at the regions, we expect China flat to down 1%, Europe flat to down 1%, and North America pretty much flat. We still see continued industry headwinds for the remainder of 2018. We expect that the short-term production issues in Europe related to WLTP will continue into Q4. Also in China, we're expecting industry volumes to remain under pressure through year end. But the key is that we expect to continue to outgrow the market in 2018 based on continued strong demand for our products.Let me now move to slide 7 to give you a brief summary of our Q3 results. Overall, I'm very pleased to the way the team is reacting to the weakening industry backdrop. With $2.5 billion in sales, we're up 3.6% organically excluding FX and Sevcon. This compares to our end market exposure, as mentioned before, down approximately 3%. So, our growth over the market was very strong in the quarter at more than 600 basis points.Looking at our regional growth, North America revenue grew double-digit. We saw low- to mid-single-digit growth in China despite the market decline. Europe revenue declined slightly year-over-year. This light vehicle growth was supplemented by positive revenue trends in commercial vehicle and off-road. Our earnings per share is at $1 excluding non-comparable items.",
                 'BXP': "At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Buda, Vice President Investor Relations for Boston Properties. Please go ahead.Sara BudaGreat.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks. Owen Thomas Thank you Sara, and good morning everyone. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that we have the Red Sox victory parade coming down Boylston Street at 11 o'clock this morning, so I'll do my best to keep all the Red Sox fans around the table in their seats after 11:00. Before I get into the details of the quarter let me take a step back and review the macro environment we're experiencing and why it is an exciting time to be part of Boston Properties. The markets where we operate continue to display strong economic performance. Unemployment is at record lows and our tenants continue to seek high quality Class A properties to attract and retain their most precious asset which is talent and the urbanization trend continues as companies and their employees seek the opportunity, community and amenities of urban locations.Boston Properties is in the middle of and benefiting from these macro trends and the investments we've made over the past few years and new development are positioning us for growth with a high level of preleasing and new developments and a long average lease term in the existing portfolio, our growth is durable and much less sensitive to where we might be in the business cycle. And finally our tenant base is diversified across market sectors and our assets across geographies which insulates us in the event of a market shift within a sector or geography. Our strategy of developing and owning Class A office properties in top tier gateway cities continues to serve us well and provides a long term competitive advantage in creating value for shareholders. Now let's get into the details of the third quarter which was another strong one for us as we made additional progress towards achieving our annual and long term goal. Specifically this quarter we generated FFO per share $0.02 above the midpoint of our prior forecast and $0.01 above Street consensus. On a year over year basis FFO per share grew 4% in the third quarter. We also increased our full year guidance for 2018 by $0.02. We also increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 19% to $0.95 per share. The largest dividend increase in the history of Boston Properties. And finally we provided a strong outlook for 2019, forecasting FFO per share growth of 7% at the midpoint of our range. We've been describing for some time our inflection point of growth based on our strong development pipeline and in-service portfolio performance. With our FFO momentum this quarter and strong outlook for 2019 that inflection point is now evident. Moving to business highlights in the quarter, we leased a 1.5 million square feet bringing us to 5.4 million square feet leased in the first three quarters well above our historical averages. We increased our in-service portfolio occupancy 70 basis points from last quarter to 91.1%. And we continue to lead in sustainability performance having been recently ranked in the top 8% of all property companies globally by [indiscernible] and we earned LEED Platinum certification for the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. Overall it was a strong quarter and I am pleased with our ongoing financial performance and the underlying strength of the business as we approach 2019. Now let's discuss the market environment and trends impacting the business. Overall economic conditions remain very positive, with third quarter US GDP growth recently reported at 3.5% which is still quite strong but down from 4.2% in the second quarter. 134,000 jobs were created in September which is also healthy, but below the monthly average over the past year. And the unemployment rate dropped to a 50 year low at 3.7%. Notwithstanding the strength of the US economy capital markets became volatile over the last month. The Fed increased rates 25 basis points in September. It's signaling at least for now an additional increase before the end of the year and multiple increases in 2019. The ten year US treasury increased rapidly earlier this year to over 3.2% and it's currently trading a little above 3.1%, up only 10 basis points since our last earnings call and about 60 basis points since the beginning of the year. A combination of interest rate increases both realized and forecast, slowing economic growth, concerns about trade wars, uncertainty around the upcoming midterm elections and the extended duration of the US economic recovery have led to materially increased volatility in the equity markets and for REIT. We've remain constructive on the market environment notwithstanding the volatility. The positive impacts of the economic growth to our leasing results far outweigh any negative of the modest interest rate increases we have experienced so far. Further current level of long term interest rate is favorable relative to historical norms and the returns we were experiencing at our new investments. While we are disappointed with the movements of our share price relative to our dividend increase and forecast growth it does not impact our capital strategy in that we are not funding our new investments with public equity. Our best use of capital today is launching new preleased developments and making select value added acquisitions for which the yields are higher than both stabilized property acquisition and the incurred cap rate and repurchasing our shares notwithstanding their material discount to NAV. Our best and cheapest source of capital is debt financing which we can utilize without materially changing our credit profile due to the new debt capacity provided by the income from our development deliveries. We have and will continue to sale select non-core assets which raises capital on the margin. The sale of the larger core asset is a less sufficient funding source given significant embedded tax gains in the result of special dividend requirements. We can accomplish our growth plan without accessing public equity capital given the debt capacity and deliver developments and if needed access to plentiful private equity capital. ",

Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.Thanks a lot, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered another quarter of excellent results as we continue our strong focus on quarterly execution while also diversifying the portfolio and building out our plans for long-term, sustainable, high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our balanced portfolio and category leadership strategy are driving top tier performance enabling us to invest to address significant unmet clinical needs in both our core and adjacent markets. In the third quarter our team delivered 9% operational and organic revenue growth with balanced contributions from all our businesses and regions.Most of our businesses and regions continue to grow faster than the market. MedSurg led the way with 11% growth while Rhythm and Neuro grew 8%, Cardiovascular sales increased 7%, all on an organic basis. We enjoyed similar broad strength regionally with operational sales up 8% in Asia-Pac, 9% in the US, 7% in Europe/Mideast Africa, 18% in Latin America/Canada. Overall, emerging market sales grew 20% operationally, led by strong performance in China and Latin America in particular.We leveraged this worldwide 9% Q3 revenue growth to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.35 which is up 12% year over year, and at the high end of our guidance range. Boston Scientific also continues to generate excellent cash flow with $569 million in adjusted free cash flow this quarter which represents a 21% year-over-year improvement.As a result of our strong performance and confidence in our outlook, we're narrowing our full-year 2018 revenue growth guidance to the high end of prior ranges and now target 8% operational and 7% organic revenue growth with a one point contribution coming from M&A.We're also raising our Structural Heart revenue guidance from $450 million to $475 million to reflect continued WATCHMAN and ACURATE strength, plus the impact of the Claret acquisition. We're also narrowing our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range from $1.37 to $1.41 to $1.38 to $1.40. On the outperformance year-to-date, plus an incremental $0.01 of FX headwind which is now expected to be a negative $0.04 to $0.05 for the full year, versus prior expectations of $0.03 to $0.04.For the fourth quarter, we're guiding to operational revenue growth of 7% to 8% and organic growth of 6% to 7% with a one-point contribution coming from M&A. Excluding the Q4 reinvestment of our second quarter tax settlements, we are targeting Q4 2018 adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.38 and Dan will detail that a bit more.I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 outlook. All references to growth are on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.",
                 'BMY': "ntationUnknown SpeakerJohn E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.Thanks, Vickie, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the Q3 call. Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks as usual and joining us for Q&A are Tom Lynch our Chief Scientific Officer and Christopher Boerner, our Chief Commercial Officer. Before we get started I'll take care of the Safe Harbor language.During the call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.We're also going to focus our comments during the call on our non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items, reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Giovanni?Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.Thank you, John, good morning everyone. Today we announced another very strong quarter with sales growth of 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 45%. With that said, I'm aware of some of the frustration that many of you have. I wanted you to know that I acknowledge your concerns and today, I'm going to give you my perspective on some of the things I've heard from you.Let me start with the news on our TMB filing then I'll provide my perspective on the quarter and finally I'll discuss how I am thinking about the company going into 2019 and beyond. Charlie will provide some color on the financials and Tom and Chris are here for your questions.So let me step back and discuss first where we are with TMB. We have always believed in pursuing areas of high unmet need and following the science to bring the best options to patients. TMB is an important example of that. As we described earlier this year, based on the emerging data for TMB we amended study 227 to evaluate PFS in high TMB patients and demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS. We did it in a way that had no impact on the statistical plan for OS in part 1a and part 2.With regard to the current regulatory filing for TMB, we have always said this was going to be a complex review, and we recognize that the additional OS data increases that complexity. We remain committed to working with health authorities on the application.We continue to believe that TMB's scientifically important and as you know, several other companies as well as academic institutions are working to advance the understanding of TMB. Based on everything we've seen, we believe TMB will play a role in the treatment of cancer and we look forward to advancing our research in this area.Turning now to our results. We delivered another great quarter with outstanding execution across the company. We saw strong demand growth and meaningful market share trends in our portfolio with Opdivo and Eliquis continuing to be positioned well. Specifically, our I-O franchise performed well in a highly competitive market. Our existing indications contributed strong results, including second-line lung where we maintain a leading share. Our new indications also performed well. We continue to see strong uptake for the adjuvant melanoma indication in the U.S. and have begun to launch in the early reimbursement markets in Europe such as Germany.Let me turn to the other newly-launched indication, first-line renal. I know there has been a lot of news and debate about how this market is going to evolve, so let me give you my perspective. I feel very good about our market position. We were the first I-O approved in renal and we've been calling on physicians who treat renal cancer for almost three years. We've established Opdivo as the leading agent in the second-line setting in a very competitive market.With the approval in first-line, Opdivo plus Yervoy is already the leading treatment for patients with intermediate and poor risk. We've achieved this by executing well in the market and leveraging a competitive profile for the combination which includes strong overall survival, compelling complete response rates, and good tolerability.We operate in competitive markets around the world and I have full confidence in the commercial organization to continue to be successful in RCC. Looking forward for Opdivo, based on the strong trends through three quarters, we continue to believe that Opdivo will grow in 2019 based on the current set of indications today.Let me now turn to Eliquis, the other key growth franchise in our business. We are seeing strong trends and Eliquis has now become the #1 oral anticoagulant in the U.S. This is an incredible milestone, reinforcing the clinical value that Eliquis offers in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. I'm confident that Eliquis continues to have an important opportunity for growth going forward.",
                 'AVGO': 'Tom KrauseThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone.Joining me today is Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom. Today, Hock is going to give you a detailed review on our core business and spend some time outlining the industrial logic behind our recently acquisition of CA. I will then spend time reviewing our Q3 results and Q4 outlook, and most importantly our financial model and capital allocation policy.Quickly on the formality. Today’s call, will primarily refer to non-GAAP financial results. A reconciliation to U.S. GAAP measures is included in today’s press release, which is available in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com. Information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call is also available in today’s press release and in our recent SEC filings. This conference call is being webcast live. A recording will be available via telephone playback for one week and archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Hock. Hock?Hock TanThank you, Tom.The strength of our business model delivered another quarter of very sustained revenues, strong earnings and free cash flows. Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.07 billion, 13% increase from a year ago and EPS came in at $4.98, a 21% increase from a year ago, while free cash flow at $2.13 billion is 42% of revenues.We have a lot to cover today. So, let’s dive right into the segments. Starting with wired. In the third quarter, wired revenue was $2.3 billion, growing 4% year-on-year. And this segment represented 45% of our total revenues. Third quarter wired results reflect strong year-on-year growth for both our networking and compute offload businesses, driven by robust demand from the cloud data center markets, as well as traditional enterprises. Networking and compute offload represented approximately 60% of our total wired segment in the quarter and grew over 10% year-on-year in the quarter. This is off the back of growing over 15% annually in the second quarter.So, this part of the wired segment is doing really well. However, cyclical headwind in certain parts of our broadband businesses has impacted year-on-year growth for the wired segment. While digital subscriber line or DSL demand remained stable, demand for PON, fiber-to-the-home in China, as well as video access, particularly North America, has been soft, compared to a very strong 2017. As a result, broadband was down year-over-year in the third quarter after being down in Q2 as well.Turning to the fourth quarter fiscal 2018. We expect networking and compute offload to continue to grow double digits year-on-year as strong demand from both the cloud and traditional enterprise sustain. However, cyclical headwinds we have seen in video access including cable and satellite are persisting into the fourth quarter. And as a result, in the fourth quarter, we expect wired to grow only mid single digits year-on-year.But, on the other hand, we’re very encouraged by the prospects for fiscal 2019. We expect strong growth in our networking business to continue, driven by new product ramps of our Tomahawk 3 switch and our Jericho2 router platforms. We also continue to see strength from our deep learning ASICs with our cloud customers. And we forecast broadband video will bottom this third quarter, as we start to enter an upcycle in 2019. On enterprise wireless access too, we expect to be the first to enable the integrated 802.11ax chipsets during this coming year, among service providers, enterprises and homes.Let me now turn to enterprise storage. For the third quarter 2018, enterprise storage revenue was $1.25 billion, representing 25% of revenue. As we have experienced and mentioned in our wired networking business, robust enterprise IT spending drove over a 70% year-on-year revenue increase. This of course includes contribution from Brocade. But even without Brocade, storage was robust year-on-year in the third quarter.Looking in the fourth quarter, strong demand from enterprise continues to be good, and we expect year-on-year storage revenue growth to accelerate.Moving on now to wireless. In the third quarter, wireless revenue was $1.3 billion, which was flat year-over-year. The wireless segment represented about 25% of our total revenue. In aggregate, wireless revenues were in line with our expectations for the third quarter. We benefited from the initial seasonal ramp at our North American OEM customer, which was partially offset by anticipated decline at our other large wireless customer. We expect this ramp at our North American OEM customer to drive wireless revenue to be over 25% sequentially, given as it may be down single digit year-on-year. Let me take some time to put this in perspective.Like all our franchises, our RF frontend business which makes up roughly half of our wireless segment, competes and competes very well, based on its technology leadership and its ability to deliver differentiated, high-performance products, generation after every generation. To generate the high returns, we expect on our substantial R&D and manufacturing investments, we focus on delivering the best FBAR technology in every new generation of smartphones. Nonetheless, from time-to-time, not that often, but time-to-time, the same technology platform used by our customer, may expand beyond one generation. And when this happens, it does create an opportunity for a customer to temporarily use lower performance alternatives in selected skews. With the benefit of hindsight, these maybe precisely what happen with this 2018 generation. But, every indication we have is that the cadence of annual platform upgrades will resume in the upcoming 2019 smartphone generation. And we believe we’re very well-positioned to win back the platform. And with 5G on the horizon, we expect this cadence of annual upgrades to sustain.',
                 'BR': "I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.W. Edings Thibault - Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.Thank you, Conesia. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Rich Daly, our CEO; Tim Gokey, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Young, our Chief Financial Officer.Before I turn the call over to the management team, a few standard reminders. During today's conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides. We encourage participants to refer to our SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors faced by our business.We will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP metrics provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of our use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable measures can be found in the earnings release and in the earnings presentation.Let me now turn the call over to Rich Daly. Rich?Richard J. Daly - Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.Thanks, Edings. Good morning to all of you joining us on this call. I'm delighted to report another strong quarter for our business. And with only two months to go before year-end, I'm also pleased to note that Broadridge is firmly on track to deliver strong full year 2018 results as well. I'll begin this morning with the highlights of our third quarter earnings on slide 5. Tim will then discuss the performance of our two segments, and Jim will review our financials and walk you through our outlook for fiscal 2018, including the drivers behind the increase in our adjusted EPS guidance. I will then close with some additional thoughts on how we are balancing, delivering attractive, short-term results, while investing for the long-term. So, let's get started.Broadridge reported strong third quarter results. Total revenues rose 6% to $1.1 billion, driven by recurring fee revenue growth of 8% and, to a lesser extent, by 9% growth in event-driven revenues. Strong organic recurring revenue growth resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted operating income and a 90-basis-point increase in margin expansion. Broadridge's adjusted EPS was also helped by a tax benefit related to equity compensation and the reduction in corporate tax rates, which further contributed to a 45% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS to $1 per share.Our third quarter numbers benefited from a confluence of positive factors, which contributed to our strong results. The first and most important factor was the continuing benefit we see from the long-term trends that have been a consistent driver of Broadridge's growth. These trends, which include mutualization and the increasing demand for data and analytics have driven the strong sales results we reported over the past several years. The on-boarding of our sales backlog remains the single biggest engine of our annual organic revenue growth. That backlog gives us excellent visibility into our organic revenue growth over the next 12 to 18 months.The second driver was the increase in market volatility that occurred in the quarter. Higher trading volumes helped our capital markets and wealth management businesses, as well as our customer communications product line. The third factor was the continued strength in event-driven revenues. All three of these factors coming together in a single period produced a very strong quarter. Tim will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments.Now, let's move to one of my favorite topics. Year-to-date Closed sales were $100 million through the end of March. Broadridge recorded $38 million in Closed sales in the third quarter, down 20% from a year ago. We remain on track to hit our full year sales targets as we expect a very healthy close to fiscal 2018. As you know, Broadridge's quarterly Closed sales results have historically been weighted towards the fourth quarter, and results for any single quarter can be heavily influenced by the timing of large deals. Our pipeline today is very strong and it includes some large deals, where we are in active dialogues with clients. These dialogues are progressing well, and we expect one or more of these deals to contribute meaningfully in the fourth quarter.Next, let's discuss guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance and reaffirming our prior guidance on total revenue, recurring revenue, adjusted operating income margin, free cash flow, and as I have just said, Closed sales. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS growth for the year to 31% to 35% from 27% to 31%. Incorporated in our new guidance are: one, strong results over the first nine months of the year, and at this point in the year, our line of sight into full-year numbers; two, a higher-than-forecasted tax benefit from equity compensation; and three, increased investment, as we take advantage of the growth opportunities we see to redeploy some of our strong operating profits back into the business. I'll touch more on this on my wrap-up.",
                 'BF.B': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Koval, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.Jay KovalThanks, Dorothy and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman’s third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.This morning’s conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company’s ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in addition to posting presentation materials that Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our Web site under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company’s financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.And with that, I will turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.Jane MorreauThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. During my comments today, I will reference the slides we posted to our Web site this morning to help you walk through our two main areas of focus which includes, first, a review of our strong year-to-date results. And second, our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2018. After I complete my prepared remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments and then we’ll open it up to Q&A.Let me start with the overall highlights which are shown on Slide 3. First, our reported net sales grew 9% during the nine months ended January 31, 2018, and reported operating income increased 15%. Sales and operating income growth were propelled by strong underlying trends and helped by foreign exchange as well as an uptick in year-over-year distributor inventory. Second, our underlying net sales growth maintained solid momentum in the third quarter, up 6% resulting in year-to-date growth of 7%.Third, we continued to deliver meaningful operating leverage with reported operating margins of 170 basis points. This expansion was due to tight management of SG&A as well as favorable timing of cost during the fiscal year. And finally, we reaffirmed our full year outlook for underlying net sales and operating income growth of 6% to 7% and 8% to 9% respectively. We also updated our fiscal 2018 earnings per share outlook to $1.43 to $1.48. This revised range reflects the impacts from tax reform and the series of stakeholder actions we announced in January, including the anticipation creation of a charitable foundation and fully funding our pension plan, not to mention our recently effected 5/4 stock split and additional foreign exchange tailwinds. I will come back to our outlook in a few moments.Before going through some additional details on our year-to-date performance, please turn to Slide 4 which helps you reconcile our third quarter EPS of $0.39. The quarter was negatively impacted by $0.05 due to tax reform. Specifically, there are three items I would like to point out. Two one time, and one ongoing. First, the repatriation tax on foreign earnings hurt our third quarter by $0.19. Second, the re-measurement of deferred taxes helped the quarter by $0.10. And third, the net ongoing tax benefit including the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, helped the quarter by $0.04.Additionally, the 5/4 stock split which occurred on February 28, is also reflected in our EPS. All EPS numbers in our earnings release from this morning incorporate new diluted share count of roughly 484 million shares. Let's now turn the Slide 5 and 6 and review growth rates for several key metrics. Underlying net sales grew a solid 6% in the third quarter, resulting in 7% growth over the first nine months. As expected, gross profit grew less than sales growth in the quarter due to higher cost flowing through in the back half of the year.Year-to-date, underlying gross profit grew in line with sales growth of 7%. Underlying A&P increased 5%, and underlying SG&A was flat. This resulted in 11% year-to-date underlying operating income growth. As highlighted on Slide 7, reported net sales increased 9% year-to-date, helped by 2 points of foreign exchange tailwind as well as a point due to year-over-year change in net distributor inventories. Slide 8 and 9 breakdown our very well balanced geographic delivery of net sales growth through the first nine months of the fiscal year.To summarize, the United States contributed two points of the company's 7% underlying net sales growth. Non-U.S. developed markets contributed another two points and the emerging markets and travel retail combined contributed the remaining three points. In the United States year-to-date reported net sales grew 7% and 5% on an underlying basis. This growth was driven by the strength of our American whiskey portfolio, led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. As well as our premium tequila brands, el Jimador and Herradura.",
                 'CHRW': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton, Vice President of Investor Relations.Robert Houghton - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call today will be John Wiehoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Biesterfeld, Chief Operating Officer and President of North American Surface Transportation. John, Andy, and Bob will provide commentary on our 2018 third quarter results. Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. We will follow that with responses to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday.I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.And with that, I will turn the call over to John.John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. In my opening remarks, I want to highlight some of the themes we'll be discussing with you today.First, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. Truckload volume trends improved sequentially, and we delivered volume growth in many of our service lines. We generated another quarter of double-digit increases in both net revenue and operating income and a 270 basis point increase in operating income margin. This strong operating profit performance, combined with improved working capital performance and the benefits of U.S. tax reform, enabled us to generate significant increases in cash flow from operations and cash returns to shareholders in the quarter. Andy and Bob will provide additional context on our financial performance in their prepared remarks.We experienced double-digit cost and price increases across most of our service lines. In our North American truckload business, the rate of increase in cost and price did moderate a bit in the quarter, however, pricing still increased 14% versus last year. Our higher prices reflect a combination of spot market activity above year-ago levels and pricing reflective of market conditions across the majority of our business portfolio.Truckload price increases modestly outpaced carrier cost increases, leading to a 50 basis point increase in total company net revenue margin in the quarter. In periods of market dislocation, we experience higher levels of repricing activity across our portfolio. As freight costs decelerate, we typically see our volumes shift more heavily towards contractual business accompanied by net revenue growth and margin expansion. This outcome is reflected in our third quarter results and highlights the strength of our business model.Our business model allows us to effectively serve customers with committed annual pricing arrangements as well as those who prefer more fluid spot market pricing. We continue to believe managing this mix of pricing commitments is the best way to both serve our customers and grow our business.With those introductory comments I'll turn it over to Andy to review our financial statements.Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we've achieved record levels of net revenue and operating income and drove significant expansion in operating income margin. In our North American Surface Transportation business, we delivered double-digit net revenue growth and a 380 basis point improvement in operating margin. Additionally, our Robinson Fresh team generated impressive growth in operating income and operating margin, despite a challenging fresh produce environment. Our great results in this quarter reflect our ongoing efforts to profitably expand our business through a focus on growth, while maintaining strong operational excellence.Now onto slide 4 and our financial results; third quarter total revenues increased 13.4% to $4.3 billion. These increases were driven by higher pricing across all transportation service lines, volume growth in LTL and Global Forwarding, and higher fuel cost. Total company net revenues increased over $100 million or 16.9% in the quarter to $694 million. Net revenue growth was led by truckload services up $78 million and LTL services up $21 million. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in air and customs service lives where combined net revenues increased over $10 million in the quarter.Total operating expenses increased $49 million, a 12.2% increase versus the prior-year period. Personnel expenses increased 14.4% primarily as a result of increases in variable compensation that reflect our improved financial performance. We believe performance-based pay is the best way to align the interest of our employees with our shareholders.Total company average head count increased 2.6% in the quarter, led by increases to support growth opportunities in Global Forwarding, which was partially offset by declining head count in Robinson Fresh. Sequentially, our head count decreased by approximately 1% from the second quarter of this year. SG&A expenses were up 6.2% in the quarter to $113 million, primarily driven by increases in purchased services and occupancy cost. These were partially offset by a decrease in equipment rental and maintenance and insurance expenses.Total operating income was $246 million in the third quarter, up 26.5% over last year. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 35.4%, up 270 basis points versus last year's third quarter and 280 basis points sequentially. Our teams did an excellent job of achieving operating margin leverage in the quarter, and this remains a top priority in the fourth quarter and into 2019. Third quarter net income was $176 million, an increase of 47.6%. These results include a $16.9 million benefit from the U.S. Tax Reform Act passed in December of 2017. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.25 in the third quarter, up from $0.85 last year.",
                 'COG': "Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Dan DingesThank you, Shaun, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us for today's Cabot third quarter 2018 earnings call. We do have a number of executive management team with me at the table. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.For the third quarter of 2018, Cabot generated net income of $122.3 million or $0.28 per share, compared to $0.04 per share for the prior year comparable quarter. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $108.9 million or $0.25 per share compared to $0.07 per share for the prior-year comparable quarter.For the third quarter of 2018, Cabot's cash from operating activities was $242.2 million compared with $189.1 million in the prior-year comparable quarter. Discretionary cash flow for the third quarter 2018 was $298.8 million compared to $207.2 million in the prior-year comparable quarter.Cabot returned to free cash flow generation during the third quarter of 2018 delivering $28.6 million of free cash flow compared $4 million in the prior-year comparable quarter. We've now generated positive free cash flow for nine of the last 10 quarters and expect this trend to be the new normal given the inflection point we find ourselves at today.As previously reported earlier this month, daily equivalent production for the quarter was 2.029 Bcfe per day which represents a 10% increase relative to the prior-year comparable quarter, and a 7% sequential increase relative to the second quarter of 2018. On a divesture adjusted basis, third quarter 2018 daily equipment production increased 19% relative to the prior-year comparable quarter.Realized natural gas prices increased 16% relative to the prior-year comparable quarter despite a 3% decline in NYMEX benchmark prices driven by an improvement in pre-hedge basis differentials from minus $0.99 last year to minus $0.54 this year.Our unit cost continue to improve as we posted an 18% decline in cost relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Cash unit cost which excludes DD&A stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges were below $1 per Mcfe for the quarter [hovering] our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow even in a low natural price cycle.During the quarter we returned $188.5 million of capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases and also paid off $237 million tranche of a 6.4% senior notes that matured in July resulting in over 15 million of annualized savings going forward. Our continued reduction in capital employed coupled with our growth and earnings has resulted in a return on capital employed for the trailing 12 month of 10.8% and improvement of over 500 basis points relative to the trailing 12 months ended in September 30, 2017.Our capital allocation update, in this morning's press release we highlighted our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through the continued execution of our share repurchase program and the announcement of our third dividend increase in the last 18 months. Our share repurchases reflect continue to believe that our stock is currently trading below intrinsic value while the dividend increase highlights confidence in the company's ability to generate strong levels of free cash flow going forward.Year-to-date Cabot has repurchased 30 million shares and win including year-to-date dividend payments as well as our expected dividend payments for the fourth quarter we will have returned over $820 million of cash to shareholders in 2018 representing a total shareholder year yield of almost 9% based on our market capitalization. Since we reactivated our share repurchase program since second quarter of 2017, we have reduced our shares outstanding by over 7% to 431.2 million shares.As a reminder, we currently have approximately 20 million shares remaining authorized under our share repurchase program. We also highlighted our commitment to returning over 50% of our annual free cash flow shareholders going forward. We believe our firm commitment to provide this level of payout shareholders annually while still preserving financial flexibility to remain opportunistic to all commodity cycles maximizes our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.Our focus on increasing return of capital coupled with an expectation for continued earnings growth should allow us to deliver continued improvement in our return on capital employed which already significantly exceeds our cost of capital.The Cabot's long-term plan to be successful, we have highlighted our four critical infrastructure projects to be completed during 2018. While we have frequently provided updates on the progress of these projects, today I'd like to provide specific details on these major accomplishments as our marketing strategy to create new major takeaway Greenfield pipeline and development in key basin and demand has finally and effectively come together.",
                 'CDNS': 'Alan LindstromThank you, Erica and I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

Copies of today’s press release dated October 22, 2018 for the quarter ended September 29, 2018 related financial tables and the CFO commentary are also available on our website.Now, I will turn the call over to Lip-Bu.Lip-Bu TanGood afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am very pleased to report that broad-based customer demand across our cloud EDA, hardware and IP product lines enable Cadence to achieve excellent operating results and financial performance in the third quarter. We live in data-driven world that is propelled by key technology waves such as cloud datacenter, 5G and machine learning. AI machine learning fueled by big data and sophisticated data analytics algorithm along with the move to domain-specific accelerators is transforming many industries, including transportation, healthcare and manufacturing. All of these lead to increasing demand for high-performance compute, high-speed connectivity and dense storage, which in turn drives strong design activity and broad demand of our innovative system design enablement solutions. Our SDE strategy continues to open up new growth opportunities as we expand our focus beyond semiconductors to systems and customers in newer verticals. As a result of these factors, we are increasing our outlook for the year. John will say more on this in a moment.I will now review the Q3 highlights starting with IP business. Our IP business had a strong quarter with double-digit growth driven by increasing royalties for Tensilica and robust demand for our memory products. Additionally, we launched two important new IP products. First, earlier today, we announced the industry’s first silicon-proven long-reach 112G SerDes IP in 7-nanometer technology. This innovative SerDes technology based on nusemi acquisition is essential to enable next generation cloud connectivity to move to 200 gigabits and beyond in the hyper-scale datacenter. We have been working closely with early adopting customers and are already taking orders as we begin to engage broadly with customers. Along with our leading DDR and PCIe solutions, we now offer the most compelling portfolio of essential IPs for the hyper-scale datacenter.Second, we also significantly enhanced the Tensilica product line with the DNA 100 Processor, which is a deep neural-network accelerator. Its innovative architecture enables the DNA 100 to deliver leading performance and power efficiency, while scaling across a broad range of compute needs. The DNA 100 is ideal for embedded inferencing applications, where latency and lack of connectivity maybe an issue, such as surveillance, drones, AR/VR, and automotive sensor fusion.Next, I will discuss highlights of our System Design and Verification solutions. The Cadence Verification Suite had another strong quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 9%. Palladium Z1 also had a strong quarter as demand for increasing hardware capacity continues. Two customers significantly expanded their installation of Palladium Z1 and overall we added 5 new logos. Our new Palladium Cloud offering, which provides on-demand cloud-based emulation capacity is ramping up nicely and contributed meaningfully to orders in Q3. Adoption of our Xcelium Simulator continues to grow as we added several new customers, including a large commitment to our technology from a market shaping customer.Digital and Signoff continues to perform well, with revenue up 9% year-over-year. Proliferation of our digital and signoff solutions continue with existing market shaping customers as well as wins with the new customers. We added 19 new logos in Q3 for our digital and signoff products. Customers tape out more than a dozen 7-nanometer designs in Q3 using Innovus. In total, more than 50 customers are using Innovus for implementations at the 7-nanometer node. We are actively engaged with very early adopter customers on their 5-nanometer designs and have started work with partners to get ready for 3-nanometer. We won 4 Partner of the Year awards at the TSMC Open Innovation Platform, including on 5-nanometer design infrastructure collaborations.',
                 'CPB': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ken Gosnell, Vice President, Finance Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Ken GosnellThank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2018. With me here in New Jersey are Keith McLoughlin, interim CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media, who'll participate in a listen-only mode. Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. With that, let me turn the call over to Keith.Keith McLoughlinThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. My name is Keith McLoughlin, the new interim CEO of Campbell Soup company and a board member since 2016. Thank you for joining our third quarter conference call today. As you have seen from this morning's press release, we announced that Denise Morrison has chosen to retire after 15 years with the company, having served the last 7 years as President and CEO. I'd like to start by thanking Denise for her leadership and dedication to Campbell. Denise repositioned our portfolio toward the faster-growing snacking and health and well-being categories with important acquisitions like Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. It has indeed been a pleasure working with her as a board member over the last few years. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire management team, we thank Denise and wish her all the very best. Let me just start out by describing how we'll handle the call today. I'll make a few brief opening comments, and then our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, will review in detail the financial results, the updated guidance, and he will answer your questions. After the Q&A, I'll make some closing remarks, and we'll end the call on time by 9:30. Let me start by describing my role. As interim CEO, my mandate from the board is clear: one, to lead the company, along with the Campbell's leadership team, until the board appoints the new chief; and two, to get the performance back on track for the company by conducting a thorough review of our strategic and operating plans, the composition of our entire portfolio and the associated allocation of our resources, capital cost and people. All this work will be under the advisement and supervision of the board. We, of course, will conduct this work with rigor, objectivity and urgency. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we delivered results that were below expectations, ours and yours. Our company has clearly faced challenges. Some of those are external factors that are impacting the entire industry, and others stem from our execution. As a board member and interim CEO, these results are unsatisfactory and disappointing to us as well as our shareholders. I've been on the Board of Directors for almost 3 years now and know Campbell well. It's a great company with talented employees and a portfolio of leading brands across multiple categories. Brands such as Pepperidge Farms, Campbell, Swanson, Arnott's, V8, Prego, Pace, Plum and Kelsen are tremendous assets for this corporation. The recent addition of the Snyder's-Lance portfolio of brands and Pacific Foods, both of which I strongly supported, will enhance our growth potential as we expand into the faster-growing snacking categories and enhance our health and well-being offerings of soup and broth. This company has and will continue to have a strong commitment to all of its stakeholders, including consumers, customers, employees and shareholders. We remain committed to bringing high-quality, differentiated products to the market at the right price and supporting our brands with compelling marketing and broad availability. These commitments will not change. Additionally, our core values will not change. Our values around operating with integrity and ethics, treating all people with dignity and respect and operating the safety and sustainability remain steadfast. What must change and will change is our execution and our financial performance. Our mandate is to create long-term value for our shareholders. We intend to take appropriate and decisive actions to ensure that Campbell is positioned to compete and win in the marketplace. That means we must take a fresh look at our strategies, our operations and our portfolio and to do so with urgency. Toward that end, beginning today, we will undertake a thorough and critical review of all aspects of our strategic and operating plans, including the composition of our entire portfolio. That work will inform our capital allocation and resource deployment priorities. Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows. We expect this process to take a few months, and we intend to share the progress of this review with you during our fourth quarter call at the end of August. ",
                 'COF': "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.Jeff NorrisThanks very much, Leanne, and welcome, everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2018 results.With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Scott Blackley, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Scott are going to walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion in the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials.Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our Annual and Quarterly Reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.And with that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Blackley. Scott?Scott BlackleyThanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with Slide 3. Capital One earned $1.5 billion or $2.99 per share in the third quarter. We had two adjusting items in the quarter, which are outlined on page 13 of tonight's slide deck.We had a $140 million net gain on the sale of an exited business which was $0.22 per share. We had a billed in our legal reserves of $170 million or $0.35 related to our ongoing AML investigations from various regulatory and legal enforcement agencies. Part of this build is to pay for $100 million civil monetary penalty which has been imposed by the OCC as part of the 2015 AML Consent Order.As is often the case, our 2015 order had a place order for civil monetary penalties. This fine represents the next step in our resolution of this matter with the OCC. We have made significant progress against the terms of the order. The remainder of the legal reserve build is related to residual AML investigation rest. As other agencies decide the OCC continue to investigate AML issues relating primarily to our former check cashing business. We will provide updates of these investigations in our quarterly filings. These adjusting items were recorded in our other category. Net of these adjusting items, earnings were $3.12 per share. In addition to these adjusting items we had one notable item in the quarter which was an impairment charge of $200 million or $0.32 per share related to investment portfolio repositioning to optimize capital and capture increased coupon to benefit future earnings.Provision for credit losses were down at 1% on a linked quarter basis and down 31% year-over-year primarily driven by allowance releases in our domestic card and auto businesses. Let me take a moment to explain the movements in allowance across our businesses which are detailed in Table 8 of our earnings supplement. Improving credit results resulted in $144 million allowance release in our domestic card business and a $75 million release in our auto business. We increased our commercial reserves by $33 million in the quarter as we increased our allowance coverage ratio.Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%. We now expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 22% before discrete items. This increase is based on our higher income from gains related to business exits and increases in non-deductible expenses from the legal reserves that I discussed earlier. Turning to Slide 4, you can see that reported net interest margin increased 35 basis points on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by seasonality, day count and the absence of the non-recurring items that we experienced in the second quarter of 2018. Net interest margin decreased seven basis points year-over-year primarily driven by increasing deposit cost. We continue to believe that increasing deposit cost will be a headwind in NIM going forward.Turning to Slide 5, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 11.2%. In the third quarter we purchased approximately 5.8 million common shares, where $570 million of our $1.2 billion 2018 CCAR share repurchase authorization. We continue to view our capital need based on existing regulations to be around 11% of CET 1. We believe we have sufficient earnings power to support growth and capital distribution. And as I mentioned last quarter, how the capital frameworks in CCAR ultimately incorporate the effect of CECL as well as the calculation in the CECL itself may impact our view on our capital requirements and with that, let me turn the call over to Rich.",
                 'CAH': "Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call.Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead, madamLisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties.Today's press release and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release.During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit your questions to one so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional question.Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter performance and discuss some strategic actions we have underway as we plan for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Then Jorge will provide some additional financial detail and color.And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Let me start by saying we recognize that today's results did not meet your expectations or ours. The biggest variable driving these results was some unanticipated disappointing performance from our Cordis business which masked an otherwise better than expected quarter.The Cordis performance not only reduced our non-GAAP operating earnings but more significantly, it created a higher non-GAAP effective tax rate. But for the Cordis tax issues alone, non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.52. We will walk you through the details.As you'll see, on an operating earnings basis, overall results came in largely as expected. In fact, the majority of the business, with Cordis being the notable exception, performed in line with or above plan highlighted by better than expected results in the Pharma segment.Let me start with some overall results, then move to segment details. Then I'll give you a broader perspective on our priorities and our plans to optimize our performance going forward and positively impact the trajectory of our business.Revenue for the third quarter reached $33.6 billion, up 6% from last year, and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 3%. Non-GAAP EPS decreased by 9% to $1.39 for the quarter versus last year's $1.53. While Jorge will go into more details, a higher than expected non-GAAP effective tax rate resulted in a $0.19 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS. $0.13 of this was related to the current and forecasted results of Cordis.Operating cash flow was strong. It exceeded $750 million for the quarter. In addition, we received approximately $850 million in net proceeds from the February 1 divestiture of our China distribution business.In the Pharma segment, revenue for the quarter increased nearly 5% to $29.7 billion, driven primarily by growth in business with existing customers offset in part by the previously announced loss of our contract with Prime Therapeutics. Segment profit for the quarter was down, but less than anticipated. So we were pleased with this performance.Contributing to the results, we saw strong performance from Red Oak. However, it was not enough to offset generic deflation. A strong flu season contributed some upside and brand inflation has tracked generally in line with our expectations.Of note this quarter was the renewal of our contract with Optum. We are very pleased that we extended and expanded this important relationship and our contract now extends through the end of our fiscal year 2024. Optum has been a customer of ours since August 2015 when we signed our first multi-year agreement. We look forward to deepening our relationship with them and pursuing new ways to partner and collaborate. Beyond Optum, we are excited to have signed some additional new business and completed key renewals with a number of smaller existing customers.Before I turn to specialty, I want to mention the efforts by the entire industry to combat the abuse of prescription opioid pain medications. As you know, we launched our Opioid Action Program last fall. In this quarter, we began distributing Narcan free of charge to more than 40 organizations who are providing the product to first responders and law enforcement.Just last weekend, more than 150 Cardinal Health employees volunteered with our friends at Kroger to staff 105 take-back events in 26 states. And we are continuing to provide grants and support for education and advocacy to prevent misuse and abuse. All of us at Cardinal Health are committed to being at the table. We are continuing to focus significant time and effort to help alleviate this public health crisis that has touched many of us and our communities.On the specialty side, this business continues to exceed our expectations. It delivered double-digit top and bottom line gains, reflecting growth with both new and existing customers. Nuclear, while not a large contributor, also performed well. So overall, Pharma performance was better than expected.Turning now to the Medical segment. For the quarter, the Medical segment posted revenue growth of 15% while segment profit increased 34% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition, partially offset by the continued challenges at Cordis.We are very pleased that the Patient Recovery business continues on track and we are making good progress on the integration. We are executing on our plan in hitting important milestones as we prepare to transition this business off of the TSAs. Our team is laser focused and we understand the importance of getting this right. There's a lot of hard work being put in by our integration team and we appreciate their diligence.",
                 'KMX': 'Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.Katharine KennyThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today as usual are Bill Nash, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Reedy, our Executive Vice President and CFO.Before we begin as usual let me remind you that our statements today regarding the company’s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These statements are based on management’s current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.For additional information on important factors that can affect these expectations, please see the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 filed with the SEC.I know you all remember to ask only one question and a follow-up before getting back in queue. We appreciate it. Bill?Bill NashThank you, Katharine, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I’ll start-off by talking about our quarterly results, then I’ll turn the call over to Tom to review financing, then I’ll update you on our initiatives.Our used unit comps for the third quarter increased by 2.7% and total used units grew by 8.2%. Used unit comps were driven by the effects of hurricane Harvey and Irma, along with higher conversion in our stores, partially offset by lower traffic. Excluding the hurricane impact, comps this quarter would have been essentially flat.Our website traffic grew in the third quarter by 19%. This is a result of the continued investment in our online customer experience, including SCO and additional functionality. Gross profit per used unit once again remained consistent at $2,148 compared to $2,155 in the third quarter of last year.Our wholesale units grew more than 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. In addition to the expansion of our store base, this growth was supported by the favorable depreciation environment we saw through most of the quarter. As a result, we were able to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers, which we believe led to a higher overall buy rate.Gross profit for wholesale unit also increased this quarter to $933, compared to $900 in last year’s third quarter. Again, we believe this was largely due to the more favorable depreciation environment. Before I turn the call over to Tom, let me cover our sales mix, SG&A and store openings.As a percentage of our sales mix, zero to four-year old vehicles increased to 81% versus 78% in last year’s third quarter. As a percent of sales, large and medium SUVs and trucks was 26%, which is down somewhat from the second quarter, but similar to last year’s third quarter.On SG&A, expenses for the quarter increased about 12% to $400 million. This represents a year-over-year increase of $81 per unit in SG&A. Several factors impacted SG&A growth, including the opening of 21 stores since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, which represents a 13% growth in our base and an increase of $8 million or $42 per unit, approximately half due to higher share-based compensation expense and half related to our accrual for incentive pay. Remember last year there was no accrual in the third quarter. As we previously discussed, we continued to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer and associated experience.Lastly, during the third quarter we opened five stores, one in a new market in Tyler, Texas and four others in existing markets, including Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle. In the fourth quarter, we will open four stores, two are in new markets for us, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which opened earlier this month and Portland, Maine. The other two will be in our existing markets of Boston and Denver.Now, I’ll turn the call over to Tom.Tom ReedyThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. With regards to sales mix by finance channel, CAF net penetration decreased modestly to 44.2%, compared to 45% in last year’s third quarter, Tier 2 represented 15.4% of sales compared to 17% in last year’s third quarter, Tier 3 from third parties grew to 10.8% of used unit sales compared to 9.7% last year and similar to prior periods this year, sales where customers paid cash or brought their own financing also increased relative to last year’s third quarter.',
                 'CCL': "ntationArnold DonaldBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today’s press release.We delivered a record third-quarter earning $1.7 billion on revenues of 5.8 billion, the highest quarterly performance in the history of our company. Adjusted earnings of $2.36 per share were higher than last year's record breaking result of $2.29 and $0.09 above the midpoint of June guidance. Once again, our operating performance overcame fueling currency moving against us this time by a further $0.02 per share compared to our June guidance, bringing the total drag to $0.08 for the quarter compared to the prior year.Strong execution will deliver a further $0.09 of improvement to the bottom-line this year compared to our June guidance, more than overcoming a further $0.06 drag from fueling currency, enabling us to increase our full-year guidance by $0.03 from a range of $4.15 to $4.25 to $4.21 to $4.25. Again, these results are testament to the effort of my fellow very passionate team members across our company globally who go above and beyond every day and of course also a testament to the tens of thousands of travel professionals who so enthusiastically support our brands.On another note, since we released our sustainability report this quarter, it is appropriate to point out the combined efforts of our 120,000 plus team members also furthers our strong commitment to sustainability, helping to achieve a 26% unit reduction in carbon emissions since establishing the goal, surpassing our 2020 target three years ahead of schedule and leaving us on track to achieve nine additional sustainability goals as discussed in our recently published annual report, sustainability from ship to shore.We also closed the quarter on another positive note, celebrating the naming of our AIDAnova at a spectacular open air concert and light show by Grammy-winning DJ and producer David Guetta at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg Germany. The sold-out event was attended by more than 25,000 people and viewed online by thousands and thousands more, another example of how we create demand for our world leading cruise line brands.This next generation ship was designed exclusively for our German guests and reinforces our leading industry presence in Germany twice that of our closest cruise peer. AIDAnova is also significantly more efficient. In fact, she is over 20% more unit cost efficient and over 35% more fuel efficient than the AIDA fleet average, which bodes well for returns in the future. AIDAnova makes history as the world's first cruise ship ever to be powered in port and at sea by liquefied natural gas, which is yet another of our many efforts to further environmental stewardship.During the quarter, we completed contracts for two more next generation ships powered by LNG both for our Princess brands to be delivered in 2023 and 2025, bringing the total number of ships on order fully powered by LNG to 11. All ongoing efforts by our brands to create demand this past quarter included Carnival Cruise Lines launching Homeport Advantage campaign highlighted by a customized airship. The blimp visited a number of critical port cities to raise awareness for Carnival Cruise Lines' industry-leading 18 U.S. embarkation options.In the process, Carnival showcased four of its fleet ships. In fact, just last week, the Choose Fun airship came to Miami to welcome Carnival Horizon to its new year around homeport. It was done with a well publicized events hosted by Carnival's Chief Fun Officer, Shaquille O'Neal and players from Miami Heat. This month-long campaign has garnered nearly 200 million media impressions. Holland America announced a partnership with Rolling Stone to create Rolling Stone Rock Room, bringing a live classic rock experience to its innovative Music Walk complementing Lincoln Center Stage, Billboard Onboard and B.B. King's Blues Club.Holland America Line also partnered with O Magazine for a new girls getaway cruise to be offered onboard their next ship Nieuw Statendam, Oprah Winfrey, the ship's godmother will personally join this very special sale. Princess topped 1 billion media impressions on the back of its Summer of Shark campaign, building on a strong partnership with Discovery Channel and the 30th anniversary of Shark Week. Also luxury brand Seabourn received approval to begin sailing to Cuba, featuring five ports of call in Cuba. Seabourn is our third brand also departures to Cuba joining contemporary Carnival brand and premium Holland America. In total, we have 7 ships and 80 calls in Cuba next year, 50% more than this year.In the UK, P&O Cruises revealed the name of its newest ship Iona in a social media event featuring UK TV personality Stephen Mulhern.",
                 'CAT': "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amy Campbell. Ma’am, the floor is yours.Amy CampbellThank you, Kate. Good morning. And welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. On the call today, I am pleased to have our CEO, Jim Umpleby; and our CFO, Andrew Bonfield, and our Vice President of finance services Joe Creed.Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you’d like a copy of today’s call transcript, we’ll be posting it in the Investors section of our caterpillar.com website.This morning we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information discussed. Details on the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our filings with the SEC and our forward-looking statements included in today's financial release.In addition a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this morning's presentation and in our release which is posted at caterpillar.com/earnings.With that I'll turn it over to Jim.Jim UmplebyThank you Amy and good morning. First I'd like to introduce Andrew Bonfield our new Chief Financial Officer. Andrew joined Caterpillar on September 1. Andrew has more than three decades of global financial experience. Most recently he was grouped CFO and board member of National Grid PLC, a British multinational electricity and gas utility company. Prior to National Grid Andrew was Chief Financial Officer at Cadbury PLC and also served as executive Vice President and Chief Financial officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb. We are delighted to have Andrew on board. He's a welcome addition to our company and our executive office.Andrew will walk you through our financial results and after I provide a brief overview of our third quarter performance as well as our outlook. We had an outstanding quarter thanks to both higher sales and excellent operational performance. Many of our mid end markets continue to be strong. Sales and revenue were $13.5 billion and 18% increase over the third quarter of last year.We also earned profit per share of $2.88 which is the highest third quarter profit per share in Caterpillar's 93-year history. This is the third consecutive quarter our company has delivered record profit per share. Adjusted profit per share was $2.86 up 47% from the third quarter of 2017.Third quarter operating profit was about $2.1 billion, 41% more than the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16.6% that's 260 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2017 and consistent with the first half of this year despite input cost headwinds. These profit levels and margins are due to the excellent work of our global team and demonstrate that our strategy for long-term profitable growth and our discipline on structural costs are delivering measurable performance improvements.We finished the quarter with $8 billion of enterprise cash. That's after paying more than $500 million in dividends, repurchasing $750 million of Caterpillar common stock and making a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution.In the first nine months of 2018, we've returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Our solid operational performance gives us the flexibility to invest on growth and to continue returning capital to shareholders. We intend to continue doing both in a sustained and disciplined way.Using the operating and execution model as our guide we will continue to invest in areas that represents a significant opportunities for profitable organic growth especially in services and new and enhanced offerings which are key components of our strategy. We also continue to look at non-organic growth opportunities, but we will do so in a disciplined way.Let me walk you through some examples of how we're investing for future growth. We continue to deploy more digital service offerings in autonomy and automation technology for mining. We're collaborating with a gold-mining customer in Nevada supported by our local CAT dealer to automate underground loaders and enable machine operators to work safely and efficiently from a control room on the surface. We're improving existing technology and accelerating deployment of new features.We're also working with a mining customer in Western Australia where we've secured a deal for the first commercial installation of a retrofit kit to enable autonomous operation of competitor mining trucks using Cat MineStar command for hauling. With this Cat system customers can operate different brands and sizes of trucks, both manned and autonomous in the same space and scale up fleet size to meet the mines' needs.",
                 'CBOE': "Now, I’d like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman. Please go ahead, Ma'am.Debbie KoopmanThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then, Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 financial results. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Chris Concannon and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.In addition, I’d like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call. Also note that references made to the planned migration of the Cboe Options Exchange is subject to regulatory review. During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials.Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.Ed TillyThank you, Debbie, and good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on our strong third quarter of 2018 at Cboe Global Markets where we increased our adjusted earnings per share by 19% year-over-year to $1.6 with net revenue of $271 million. Our solid financial results enable us to continue to invest in our long-term growth while returning nearly $84 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Trading and SPX options continue to grow at a double-digit pace, increasing 12% for the quarter over Q3 2017. We saw trading volume in VIX options and futures slowly build month over month throughout the quarter then surge in October as volatility increased. And investors around the world turned to Cboe to manage the risk.Other volume highlights for the quarter included ongoing success in our FX market where average daily notional value for the third quarter rose 19% from the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our European equities business with increase in market share and volume.I’ll look now at the volatility landscape throughout the quarter and beyond. As major stock market averages hit all-time highs and we are now in the longest running bull market in history, we saw the VIX futures term structure returned to its normal upward sloping shape along with steady volume increases in our VIX product complex.As we expected, the lingering effect of the February market shock that led to a flat VIX term structure in the second quarter was unsustainable. And we began to see growth in trading strategies used to capture volatility risk premium, volatility hedges and return of large trades in VIX options.The return of higher volatility in October that led to record volumes in SPX options and VIX futures was fueled by an 11% decline in the S&P 500 comparable to the move we saw in February. Yet the VIX index and VIX futures suggest that the current volatility environment is substantially different than what we experienced earlier this year.We expect to see changes in the VIX index when markets move and risk expectations change. We believe the difference this time is that the correction was not compressed over just a few days as it was in February, rather we saw an orderly repricing of risk that has occurred over a period of weeks allowing traders to monetize hedges in both SPX and VIX options and reposition their exposures tactically.Regardless of market conditions, we remain focused on our commitments to product innovation, seamless training solutions and leading-edge technology. Product innovation remains the cornerstone of our growth strategy. I’m pleased to report on our entry into the growing corporate bond marketplace with the successful launch of futures on Cboe iBoxx iShares High Yield Corporate Bond Index IBHY on September 10, and Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Index IB on October 8.",
                 'CBRE': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Burke, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Brad Burke Thank you, and welcome the CBRE's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and it is posted on our website, cbre.com. On the Investor Relations page of our website, you will find a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks.This presentation contains forward-looking statements. These include statements regarding CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, investment levels and financial performance expectations. These statements should be considered estimates only and actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to our third quarter 2018 earnings report furnished on Form 8-K and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.During our remarks, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by SEC regulations. Where required by these regulations, we have provided reconciliations to what we believe are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations together with explanations of these measures can be found within the appendix of this presentation. Additionally, all growth rate percentages cited in our remarks are in local currency unless otherwise stated.Please turn to Slide 3. Participating on our call today are Bob Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Groch, our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development.Now, please turn to Slide 4, as I turn the call over to Bob.Bob Sulentic Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. This is an exciting time for CBRE. We continue to advance the company on multiple fronts, while driving strong results for our clients and shareholders. As you've seen from our press release, we delivered double-digit increases on the top and bottom lines. The 14% fee revenue growth was led by particularly strong performance from our leasing business. This is reflective of deep relationships with our large occupier client base and our ability to attract the industry's top professionals to our increasingly differentiated operating platform.Occupier outsourcing again had excellent growth fueled by the secular shift toward outsourcing and CBRE's globally integrated capabilities. Our development services business had another strong quarter and is on track for record profits in 2018. I also want to comment on two important strategic initiatives that should have a big impact on CBRE. The first is the reorganization of the company, which we announced in August. We have clarified lines of authority for our management team, which will increase accountability, introduced operational and cost efficiencies and enhanced business line quality across our business. This new structure will also increase financial transparency for our company, and we hope promote greater transparency across our sector.The second initiative was the introduction yesterday of our flexible office space offering called Hana. This service evolved from a tremendous amount of interaction with and encouragement from our clients. Our deep relationships with property investors and occupiers, and what we have learned from our workplace experience service CBRE 360 position us well to succeed with this new offering.Hana is perfectly suited for property owners, who believe they can add value to their buildings with the flexible space solution that keeps them in control of their assets and for companies that want more flexibility in their occupancy to meet changing business needs and create a better workplace experience for their people. This is a rapidly expanding market that could comprise 5% to 10% of the total occupied space within a decade. We have assembled an exceptional team to capture this opportunity and kicked off our marketing efforts yesterday with a robust deal pipeline. Hana will operate, as part of our real estate investments business beginning in 2019.Now, Jim will take you through our third quarter in detail.Jim Groch Thank you, Bob. As Bob noted CBRE delivered another quarter of strong growth. Fee revenue increased 14% driven by 10% organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 12% and adjusted EPS grew by 22% both in US dollars. Fee revenue for our combined regional services business increased by 13% with adjusted EBITDA increasing 6% both in US dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for our regional business declined one percentage point versus the prior year quarter to 15% consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year.As you will recall, we outlined a significant investment program for 2018, as we reinvested the savings associated with tax reform, but for these investments, adjusted EBITDA would have grown faster than fee revenue. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA margins on fee revenue for our regional services business would have been approximately 40 basis points higher, absent the impact of FX and the acquisition of lower margin, but typically high growth outsourcing businesses. The impact of FX notable in Asia-Pacific, where adjusted EBITDA would have increased by 7% excluding all FX effects rather than declined by 4% in US dollars.",
                 'CBS': "David Bank - CBS Corp.Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining us with today's remarks are Joe Ianniello, our President and Acting CEO; David Nevins, our Chief Creative Officer; and Chris Spade, our Chief Financial Officer. Following Joe, David, and Chris' remarks, we will open the call up to questions. Please note that during today's conference call, results will be discussed on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise specified.The third quarter and year-to-date 2018 results are adjusted to exclude costs related to certain corporate matters and certain benefits associated with tax law changes. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website. Also, note that statements on this conference call relating to matters, which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Risks and uncertainties are disclosed in CBS Corporation's SEC filings.A webcast of this call and the earnings release related to today's presentation can also be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at cbscorporation.com.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.Joseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.Thank you, David, and welcome to our call. And good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I want to take a minute and thank Adam Townsend for his outstanding years leading CBS Investor Relations. Showtime is in great hands with Adam as the CFO.As David Bank mentioned, with me here today is David Nevins, our Chief Creative Officer. In his new expanded role, David oversees all of the entertainment programming across the company. So, I thought it would be helpful for you to hear from him today. He obviously brings a wealth of experience to this position as well as a clear track record of success at Showtime.I'd like to also welcome Chris Spade, our new Chief Financial Officer. While Chris is new to this position, she joins us having been an outstanding CFO for Showtime, and she's been a key member of that business for more than two decades. I've worked with both David and Chris for many years, and I look forward to their contributions today and in the future.Now, let me tell you about our third quarter results. Revenue was up 3% to $3.3 billion, and EPS was up 12% to $1.24. This was our best third quarter ever in revenue and EPS. I am also pleased to tell you that we are reaffirming our outlook for 2018 with revenue growth in the high-single digits and EPS growth in the high-teens. Our success continues to be fueled by all the ways we are executing on our long-term strategy.We are driving new incremental and recurring revenue from a number of significant growth areas: retrans and reverse comp along with skinny bundles; our over-the-top direct-to-consumer streaming services; global content licensing; and our expanded audience monetization efforts. Combined, these growth initiatives will generate more than $4 billion in revenue this year, which is up nearly 75% from 2015.Going forward, as we continue to position CBS as a global multi-platform premium content company, we are confident that there is significant upside from here. Nowhere is the success of our strategy more evident than in the ways in which we are growing our subscribers across platforms. Quarter after quarter, our must-have content is driving increases at CBS and Showtime, pretty unique for a media company nowadays. In fact, we have now grown our company's – our total company subs every single quarter since we started discussing this metric. Whether it's large traditional bundles, smaller streaming packages, or standalone direct-to-consumer services, we are distributing our content in all the ways consumers want it and reaping the benefits.And as we grow our subs, we continue to negotiate deals with distributors that better reflect the fair value of our content. So, we are growing our ARPU or average rate per sub as well. In fact, as viewers move to smaller offerings, they are transitioning to new platforms that pay us more than the old one. Our sub growth is especially strong where we get the highest rates, on our direct-to-consumer streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. And we are more confident than ever that we can achieve our new goal of 8 million subs combined from these services in 2019 a full year ahead of our original schedule.In addition, that total doesn't include the direct-to-consumer subs that we are just beginning to get internationally. All Access Canada is off to a solid start, and we continue to expand into new markets. Here in the fourth quarter, we are launching our Australian version called 10 All Access. This new platform will include local programming for Network 10 as well as our premium CBS content, further distinguishing us from other leading SVOD platforms. We will continue to expand into new territories in 2019, and we are confident that digital distribution on a global scale will be very lucrative for CBS.",
                 'CE': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Surabhi VarshneyThank you, Anita. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations.With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer.Today’s presentation includes statements about expectations for the future results and plans that are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from such statements. And additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ can be found in the posted materials.We will also discuss non-GAAP measures today. You can find information related to these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures on our website in the Investor Relations section. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials are available on the SEC’s EDGAR system.Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter 2018 earnings release via Business Wire and posted slides and remarks about the quarter in the Investor Relations section of our website after market close. Since we published our comments yesterday we will now open the lines for your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorWe will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.P.J. JuvekarYes, hi.Mark RohrGood morning, P.J.P.J. JuvekarEvery week I get some kind of price increase announcement from Celanese in acetyls. So my question is, how are your paint coatings and polyester fiber customers taking this price increases? And I guess, you’ve been leading the market in acetyls, if there is new capacity that comes in, would that sort of upset the apple cart in terms of the discipline?Mark RohrHi, P.J. This is Mark. Thanks. Let me back up a little bit. I think there’s over the years people have kind of you know made fun of our price increases, but we did that for a reason, a very specific reason. When you deal with customers, my personal experience is customers don't mind pricing. They just don't want to be disadvantaged or surprised.We go to great lengths to very openly share what's going on in the market and how we're responding do that and with great lengths working with individual, with customers help them moderate and manage and deal with those price increases.So broadly speaking, that's why you see us do what we do and because of that we have found that our customers always respond well to what we do and I mean sometimes, it's tough, but they always respond well.We've not seen any unusual pushback or anything else from pricing and if you look at the level of inflation, we're seeing that P.J. you've been going around a few years, you've seen lots of cycles at inflation, it’s not that severe.There are different areas where it's hitting us, but it's not unusual nor is it anything that few years ago we didn't see in a routine kind of basis with multi-hundred million dollar year-over-year kind of the raw material inflation number.So, I know there's a lot of worry about that out there, but I don't quite -- I can't quite quantify it and I don’t know why people are so concerned about it.You got to work hard to stay ahead. We do. We work properly with our customers, but we haven't seen any particular issue with it. And I roll it back to say as you relate to polyester, no big issue, no big issue there.P.J. JuvekarYeah, don't get me wrong. We appreciate your price increases and admire that you are able to raise pricing and recover raws.Mark RohrYeah. No I didn't take it that way. I just want to make sure, that people understand that, that we do that, but we're a bit more public than others, but we would do that on purpose and we do it for a reason and it’s really just to focus in and help our customers.P.J. JuvekarRight. And then just Mark, good question on your guidance for 2019. You mentioned that gains in EM engineered materials would be offset by winter seasonality. I was wondering if you can just explain what do you mean by winter seasonality? Thank you.Mark RohrWell it’s -- thank you, PJ.. Those of you that have followed things like the coating businesses in China for a while, understand that you go through these seasonality kind of periods.And classically, in our business segments, you would have weaker winter seasons or fall seasons fourth quarters and weaker first quarters and that varies between would vary between coatings businesses in Europe, Chinese New Year, seasonality and auto builds. So a lot of things that kind of roll into that generically.",
                 'CELG': "Good morning, and welcome to the Celgene Investor and Analyst Conference Call. I would like to remind you this call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the call over to Nina Goworek, Executive Director of Investor Relations at Celgene.Nina Goworek - Celgene Corp.Joining me on today's call with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; Nadim Ahmed, Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology franchise; and Dr. Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer. Also available for the Q&A portion of the are Dr. Rupert Vessey, Global Head of Research and Early Development Group; and Jonathan Biller, our General Counsel.As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these results can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC.These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are available as part of the earnings release.I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.Thank you, Nina, and welcome to the Celgene Investor Relations team. It's great to have you.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate the opportunity to review the outstanding results from our third quarter and the sustained progress achieved on critical corporate objectives. Across functions and geographies, Celgene teams produced excellent business momentum leading to strong financial performance. This includes volume driven growth across brands and rapid adoption in key markets around the world. David, Terrie and Nadim will describe our commercial performance in detail later during the call.This momentum gives us increased confidence in our outlook for the full year which, again, supports raising our 2018 guidance. Total revenue is increased from $15 billion to $15.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share is raised from a range of $8.70 to $8.75, to a range of $8.75 to $8.80.We have also generated a series of clinically meaningful data in new settings or combinations for existing products, such as the recently announced Phase III studies for OTEZLA and REVLIMID. And Phase III results published in the New England Journal of Medicine for ABRAXANE and REVLIMID. These data are expected to significantly add to the already well-established value propositions of our medicines globally.Importantly, we are making meaningful progress advancing our late stage pipeline to high value inflection points over the next 12 to 18 months. Later in the call, Dr. Jay Backstrom will provide a regulatory update on these potential blockbusters, ozanimod, fedratinib, luspatercept, liso-cel and bb2121, all expected to launch by the end of 2020.We are excited by the breadth and depth of data featuring our existing products and promising hematology pipeline expected at the American Society of Hematology meeting in early December. During his prepared remarks, Nadim will preview key abstracts we expect to be presented at one of the most diverse and forward-looking ASH meetings in Celgene's history.Led by Dr. Rupert Vessey, our increasingly productive Research and Early Development team, along with our external collaborators are making significant headway. In September, members of our senior management team and I met with dozens of scientists working across our major research centers of excellence. They are inflammation, epigenetics, immune-oncology, protein homeostasis and neurosciences. Important and promising new programs are emerging from these research teams with encouraging signals of activity which will soon form the basis for our next generation mid-stage pipeline.So far this year, we have filed five INDs for molecules with novel mechanisms of action. After multiple years of advancing an average of eight INDs per year, we have identified a group of highly promising agents with the potential for a first marketing approval as early as 2022.Coupled with the continued growth of our in-line brands and anticipated launches for five key late-stage products, this next wave of innovative compounds gives us renewed confidence in our longer term outlook. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in early research and development during our investor event planned for ASH.As our growing pipeline advances, exquisite clinical development becomes an even greater strategic imperative. To enhance and ensure success, we have created a dedicated mid- to late-stage clinical development function led by Dr. Alise Reicin. Alise joins us from EMD Serono, where she has outstanding experience in global drug development that spans important indications in cancer and immunology and inflammation.",
                 'CNC': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ed Kroll, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Ed KrollThank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our 2018 third quarter earnings results conference call.

The playback code number for both dial-ins is 10123967.Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor Provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q dated today, October 23, 2018, and our Form 10-K dated February 20, 2018, and other public SEC filings.Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2018 press release, which is also available on our website at centene.com under the Investors section.Finally, a reminder that our next Investor Day will be held on Friday, December 14, in New York City.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?Michael NeidorffThank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter 2018 earnings call.During the course of this call, we will discuss third quarter financial results and provide update on Centene's markets and products. We will also bring you up to date on the integration of Fidelis.Let me begin with Fidelis. The third quarter was our first full quarter with Fidelis operating as our New York State Healthcare. The integration is going very well progressing as expected. We will further enhance the quality of care and current capabilities of Fidelis, as we add case management and clinical programs and incorporate our data analytics tools. We are on track to achieve the synergy and increasing targets. On a run-rate basis, we expect Fidelis to add approximately $11.5 billion in revenue and over $500 million in adjusted EBITDA including net synergies.Now on to the third quarter financial results. We are pleased to report another solid quarter marked by significant top and adjusted bottom-line growth. It is important to clarify that the operating metrics in the quarter were strong as this may have been obscured by three offsetting adjustments booked in the quarter.Two of the adjustments relate to the contracts that have expired. These were $140 million benefit related to the California IHSS program reconciliation and a $110 million charge related to the expiration of our Veterans Affairs contract. The third adjustment related to a $30 million contribution to our charitable foundation.Membership at quarter-end was 14.4 million recipients. This represents an increase of approximately 2.1 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2017. This growth is in part a result of the acquisition of Fidelis which closed effective July 1.Third quarter revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $16.2 billion. The HBR decreased 170 basis points year-over-year to 86.3%. This was primarily attributable to the benefit of the IHSS program reconciliation and membership growth in the exchange business.The adjusted SG&A expense ratio increased 110 points paid year-over-year to 10%. This was a result of the growth in the exchange business which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio and one-time costs associated with the exploration of our VA contract.We reported adjusted third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.79 compared to $1.35 in the same period last year. This represents growth of 33%. Consistent with our expectations, adjusted net earnings have developed in a quarterly pattern similar to last year.Please note, we reiterate our comments regarding visibility into $69 billion plus in total revenue for 2019. As is our practice, we will provide full detail and an update of 2019 guidance at our December 14th, Investor Day.We are still finalizing our annual planning process. But based on the views to-date the current adjusted earnings per share consensus for 2019 would be within our guidance range.Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2018 guidance in his prepared remarks.A quick comment on Medical cost trends. We continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends. This is consistent with our expectation in the low-single-digits.I would also like to make a comment on pharmaceutical cost and the evolution of the PBM model. There have been some recent media articles regarding this topic and our Ohio Medicaid Health Plan Buckeye Community Health. To clarify, Buckeye is not charging the state more than any other MCO per strip. Health plans were paid a flat per number rate and cannot charge the state a penny more, even if that member has more prescriptions.",
                 'CTL': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Valerie Finberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for CenturyLink. Please go ahead, ma'am.Valerie Finberg - CenturyLink, Inc.Thank you, Melody. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink third quarter 2018 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Neel Dev, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Unless otherwise noted, prior periods are provided on a pro forma basis, assuming both the sales of the legacy CenturyLink data centers and co-location business and the acquisition of Level 3 occurred as of January 1, 2017.Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, free cash flow and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA discussed on the call today exclude integration-related expense and other items as noted in our earnings materials.All of our supplemental earnings materials, including the presentation we will review on the call, can be found in the Investor Relations section of the CenturyLink's website at ir.centurylink.com. You can see our forward-looking statements on page 2 of the 3Q 2018 earnings presentation, which says that the presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties and may result significantly from those statements. Additional information is available in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Finally, the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our Investor Relations website.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.Thank you, Valerie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today.A week ago today marked the one-year anniversary of CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3. To date, we're pleased with our integration progress. On our third quarter's earnings call last year, which was just a few days after the acquisition closed, I told you that the combined company is focused on a few things; profitable revenue growth, operational excellence to reduce costs and drive a great customer experience, and increasing free cash flow per share. We made good strides on all of these objectives over the last year.You can certainly see the benefits of our initiatives to reduce costs and increase free cash flow per share in our strong synergy achievement, margin expansion and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. I believe these results demonstrate the value of the acquisition. We are very focused on operating the business with discipline and efficiency, and you'll continue to see us focus on expanding margins and growing the bottom line.Additionally, with our focus on profitable revenue, we've taken a hard look at the business and stopped certain product lines, exited unprofitable contracts and changed our approach to how we sell things like CPE. While these decisions negatively affect revenue, they're the right decisions for the business to drive growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.We've made a great deal of integration progress this year, combining networks and systems, improving how we interface with our customers and making it easier for our employees to do their jobs. While we still have more integration work to do over the next year or two, our focus shifts more and more to transformation.On today's call, we'll follow our usual process. Neel Dev will provide an update on our detailed financial results and our updated full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on our integration and transformation progress and the company in general. After that, we'll open it up for your questions.Before I turn the call over to Neel, I wanted to take just a moment to introduce him to those of you who have not met him. Neel has been with the combined company for 14 years, having joined Level 3 in 2004. While he was part of Sunit's team since that time when I joined Level 3 in 2008 as the COO, Neel was also part of my team as our operational finance lead. I've worked closely with him since 2008 and have frequently given him large roles such as in the Global Crossing and tw telecom acquisitions.I also asked Neel to lead the integration planning team for Level 3 during the acquisition by CenturyLink. After the close in his role with finance, he has been instrumental in driving our synergy achievement and other integration initiatives. I have very high confidence in his abilities, his focus on results, and I am very pleased to have him as the CFO of CenturyLink.With that, I'll turn it over to Neel.Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.Thank you, Jeff. I really appreciate those kind words and I'm excited to take on the CFO role for CenturyLink.",
                 'CERN': "Welcome to Cerner Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's date is October 25, 2018, and this call is being recorded.Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements may be found under Item 1A in Cerner's Form 10-K, together with the company's other filings.A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this earnings call can be found in the company's earnings release which was furnished to the SEC today and posted on the Investors section of Cerner.com. Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation.Marc G. Naughton - Cerner Corp.Thank you, Carmen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll start with a review of our numbers; John Peterzalek, our Chief Client Officer, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations; and then Brent Shafer, our Chairman and CEO, will provide closing comments.Turning to our results, we had a solid Q3 with all key metrics within our guidance ranges. Revenue was at the low end of our guidance range primarily due to lower-than-expected software and technology resale which was largely offset by reduced expenses. The Q3 lower level of software is expected to also impact Q4, leaving our earnings outlook for Q4 below consensus estimates. I would note that our full year outlook remains within our previously provided full year guidance range.Our bookings in Q3 were $1.588 billion, which reflects a 43% increase over $1.111 billion in Q3 of 2017. Q3 of last year was our lowest bookings quarter, so it was an easy comparable, but our year-to-date bookings growth of 19% is also strong. We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $14.7 billion, which is down from $14.79 billion in Q2.Recall that beginning in 2018, our backlog calculation under the new revenue standard excludes revenue potentially impacted by contract termination clauses. Most government contracts have standard termination clauses. And as I mentioned before, some of our long-term contracts also have them. In our experience, clients rarely exercise this option. So this doesn't change our total long-term revenue opportunity; it just reduces the calculation of backlog.Moving to revenue which was $1.34 billion in Q3. This is up 5% over Q3 of 2017 and, as I mentioned, at the lower end of our guidance range due to a lower-than-anticipated level of licensed software and technology resale.I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q3 of 2017. Licensed software revenue was $140 million, down 3% primarily due to lower-than-forecasted licensed software bookings in the quarter. This is in part due to the lower level of predictability related to fewer regulatory deadlines as we have discussed in the past. Technology resale increased 6% to $60 million, but was below our forecast.Subscriptions revenue was $79 million in Q3 of 2018, down from $123 million in Q3 of 2017. As we have discussed, subscriptions were impacted by our adoption of the new revenue standard which reduced subscription backlog and led to us classifying a portion of subscription revenue as support. Professional services revenue grew 14% to $257 million, driven largely by growth in our Works businesses.Managed services increased 15% to $302 million, driven by strong year-to-date bookings. Support and maintenance was up 5% to $278 million, reflecting our expected low single-digit growth plus the previously discussed impact of the new revenue standard. And finally, reimbursed travel was $24 million which is flat year-over-year.Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue was up 5% from the year-ago quarter at $1.188 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $152 million increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q3 was 82.8%, which is up from 82.5% in Q2 of 2018 and down from 84.1% a year ago.Now I'll discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, acquisition-related adjustments and other adjustments all is detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.Looking at operating spending, our third quarter GAAP operating expenses of $903 million were up 9% compared to $825 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were up 9% compared to Q3 of 2017. Looking at the line items, sales and client service expense increased 9% over Q3 of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to our services business.Sales and client service was down 4% compared to Q2 of 2018. This was driven largely by lower variable compensation related to the lower software in Q3 and our slightly lowered outlook for the year. Software development expense increased 12%, driven by 5% increase in gross R&D, a 20% increase in amortization, and slightly lower capitalized software. G&A expense was up 10% and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased 53% year-over-year.",
                 'CF': "I'd now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.Good morning and thanks for joining the CF Industries third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.CF Industries reported its third quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2018, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $300 million and approximately $1.1 billion, respectively. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $134 million and $709 million for the same periods in 2017, a 50% increase year-to-date over 2017 results.We added $294 million of cash to the balance sheet during the quarter, while at the same time repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $90 million.Including activities after the quarter end, through October 31, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 3 million shares for approximately $150 million, which leaves $350 million still remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. Cash on the balance sheet stands at approximately $1.1 billion as of this call.These results reflect continued strong execution by the CF team against the backdrop of an improving market environment. We are operating well, and most importantly we're doing it safely. Our rolling 12-month recordable incident rate at the end of the quarter was 0.67 incidents per 200,000 work hours, considerably better than industry averages. And as Bert will discuss, we are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter and the upcoming spring application season.Longer term, we believe global market fundamentals will continue to enable CF Industries to generate significant cash through the foreseeable future. First, we expect the global nitrogen supply and demand balance to continue to tighten. Global demand for nitrogen has grown at a long-term annual rate of approximately 2% per year. At the same time, net global urea supply additions are expected to fall short of this rate as you can see on slide 10 in our materials.All the new nitrogen capacity in North America has been running for some time and there are limited number of new plants expected to be started up globally through 2022. Because it takes roughly four years to construct an ammonia/urea complex, it is unlikely that significant capacity will come online during this time period beyond what is already visibly under construction today.Second, we believe global energy fundamentals are likely to drive international hydrocarbon prices higher, while at the same time, North American natural gas prices should continue to remain low. CF benefits greatly from this spread as it elevates production cost for the upper half of the global nitrogen supply curve, while keeping our production costs low as estimated in our 2019 cost curve shown on slide 15.As Dennis will go into more detail later, global investments in oil and gas exploration and development since 2014 have declined dramatically. U.S. shale, however, has seen increased investment. This resulted in higher production in the U.S., which kept natural gas in North America trading around $3 per MMBtu, despite the strong growth in U.S. gas demand.In fact, the NYMEX forward curve for gas is priced well below $3 per MMBtu through 2025. We believe these factors will support CF's structural cost advantages in the years ahead. Along with our consistent operational performance, this should further strengthen our cash generation, and allow us to create significant shareholder value.Now, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk about the market environment in more detail, then Dennis will discuss our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.Thanks, Tony. Our performance during the third quarter has positioned CF well, as we work through our fall ammonia book and continue preparations for the spring application season. First and foremost we had solid shipments in the quarter. This included a successful UAN fill program, along with 780,000 tons of UAN and urea exports combined. These efforts kept our plants running at full rates and allowed us to capture international sales when domestic customers were unwilling to take a position. We also built a strong book of business into the fourth quarter as customers accepted that significantly lower nitrogen prices were unlikely.",
                 'CHTR': "I would now like to turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.Stefan Anninger Good morning and welcome to Charter's third quarter 2018 investor call.

At the end of the third quarter 67% of our acquired residential customers were in our new Spectrum pricing and packaging, up from 62% at the end of the second quarter. So we’re delivering better products at better prices, more customers which will driver lower churn, faster customer growth and [Technical Difficulty] growth. Over the last year we’ve grown our total Internet customer base by over 1.2 million customers or 5.3%. In video, net loss this quarter were lessened than the third quarter of ‘17. In the third quarter we grew cable revenue by 4% year-over-year and adjusted cable EBITDA grew by 5.5%. During the quarter we rolled out our Gigabit speed offering over 70 million homes passed, using very capital efficient DOCSIS 3.1 technology. Earlier this month, we launched our Gigabit service to more than 12 million additional homes passed. So we now offer Spectrum Internet Gig with over 95% of our passings and we will be offering Giga service in nearly all of our 51 million homes passed by the end of this year, and over 80% of our residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provide 100 megabits or more of speed. Our faster speeds are having an intensive impact driving Internet customer growth. In early September we executed a full market launch of our Spectrum Mobile service with a goal of accelerating connectivity relationship growth, and we expect our mobile product to be profitable on a standalone basis once it reaches scale. We now offer mobile services to both new and existing Spectrum Internet customers on both Apple and Android device. Spectrum Mobile is being marketed by TV, radio, direct mail and through other advertising and marketing platforms and our selling machine is scaling across key existing sales channels including our stores, inbound call centers and online. We offer our mobile services at prices that give new and existing customers the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars per year on their mobile bills. Our unlimited service costs $45 a month and our By the Gig service is $14 per gigabyte. So far our broader market launch has gone very smoothly. Our mobile operations and the service itself are scaling and working well. We started selling the product after Labor Day, so our total customer base is relatively small at quarter end about 21,000 lines. We’re seeing steady new sales growth and yield in traditional cable sales as we build brand and product awareness. In the new next few months, we will enable customers to transfer their existing handsets. We also have a pipeline of product improvements that will extend through the middle of next year and which will continue to make our product more attractive and easier to switch and entire household’s mobile service package. Ultimately the goal is to use Spectrum Mobile to save customers’ money via an integrated superior product offering, driving faster customer growth and better retention, our penetration and greater keep-it-up capacity. Shifting back to cable, our all-digital initiative is on schedule for completion by year end. About 95% of our footprint is now all-digital, by the end of this year the whole company will be fully digitized as we deploy fully functioning two-way digital set-top box, mostly our WorldBox and increasingly third-party IP devices on all remaining analog TV outlets that we serve.",
                 'CVX': "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chevron Corporation, Ms. Pat Yarrington. Please go ahead.Patricia E. Yarrington - Chevron Corp.All right. Good morning and thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Pierre Breber, Executive Vice President, Downstream & Chemicals; and Wayne Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.But before I get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements and we ask that you review the cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.Turning now to Slide 3, an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $2.11 per diluted share. This is more than $2 billion higher than the same period a year ago and this is the highest recorded earnings per share since third quarter 2014. The company's year-to-date earnings were $11.1 billion or $5.79 per diluted share. This was $5 billion higher than the same period a year ago.The quarter included the unfavorable impacts of a project write-off, an impairment, and a nonrecurring contract settlement, which totaled $930 million. These were partially offset by a $350 million gain on the sale of our Southern African refining and marketing assets. Foreign exchange losses for the quarter were $51 million.A reconciliation of special items, foreign exchange and other non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Excluding these special items and foreign exchange impacts, earnings totaled $4.7 billion or $2.44 per share.Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $9.6 billion. Excluding working capital effects, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. Cash flow from operations continued to grow in the third quarter and was the highest it has been in nearly five years, back when Brent crude prices were averaging about $110 per barrel. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $21.5 billion, about $7 billion more than a year ago.At quarter-end debt balances stood at approximately $36 billion, giving us a debt ratio of 19%. During the third quarter we paid $2.1 billion in dividends and we repurchased $750 million of our shares during the quarter. We currently yield 4%.Turning to Slide 4. Our third-quarter cash flow from operations, excluding working capital effects, increased to $9.2 billion, reflecting higher realizations and growing volumes in our U.S. and international upstream.On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, totaled $23.3 billion. This included $600 million in discretionary U.S. pension contributions, $800 million in deferred income taxes, and affiliate dividends approximately $2.5 billion less than equity affiliate earnings.Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion and $9.8 billion year-to-date. The result, free cash flow excluding working capital effects of $5.6 billion for the quarter and $13.5 billion year-to-date.Through the first three quarters of the year, normalized for $60 Brent, we are on track to deliver the $14 billion cash generation guidance communicated at the Analyst Meeting in March.Turning now to Slide 5, a view of our sources and uses of cash through the quarter. We are delivering on all four of our financial priorities. We maintained our commitment to competitive dividend growth by paying out $2.1 billion in cash dividends to our shareholders. We continue to fund our highest return projects at a reasonable pace. We further strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by $2.4 billion, lowering our debt ratio to 19%. And finally, we commenced our share repurchase program in the third quarter and returned $750 million of surplus cash to shareholders.Now on Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. Through the third quarter. We received before tax asset sale proceeds of $1.9 billion, including the divestment of our Southern African refining and marketing business. Most recently, we signed sale and purchase agreements including the sale of our 12% non-operated interest in the Danish Underground Consortium and the sale of our 40% interest in the Rosebank project west of Shetlands in the UK.In addition, we continue the process of marketing our UK Central North Sea assets. As with all divestments, we are focused on generating good value from any transaction. The progress we have made year-to-date on portfolio optimization puts us on track to generate $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale proceeds over the 2018 to 2020 time period as we guided back in March.Turning to Slide 7, third quarter 2018 after tax earnings $4 billion were approximately two times that of third quarter 2017. Special Items reduced earnings by approximately $1 billion between periods. In the current period, special items included a gain on the sale of South African R&M assets. The write-off of the Tigris project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an impairment on an asset held for sale, and a non-recurring contractual settlement. All of which netted to a negative $580 million.",
                 'CMG': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to Coralie Witter. Please go ahead.Coralie Tournier Witter - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.Hi, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website, at ir.chipotle.com.Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter, the potential of a number of our digital sales strategies, sales trends and forecasts for future comparable sales; expected new restaurant openings; estimates of future food, labor, marketing, and maintenance and repair costs, and G&A spend; statements about our expected effective tax rates, and projections of the amount and timing of transformation and restructuring costs and stock repurchases, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website, which can be found at the link included on the Presentations page.I\'d also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16, and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.We will start today\'s call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period.And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I\'m pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategies to win today and cultivate a better future are working.Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4%, and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trends enabled us to expand restaurant level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year, to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual cost grew 62%, to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36. While the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new "For Real" marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference, and drives purchase combined with great operations, drives results.Additionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace. And the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent, and our all-manager conference. We exited the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter. And we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.Before I dive deeper into this quarter\'s bright spots, I\'d like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on five focus areas. One, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty. Two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience. Three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput. Four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model. And five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu, and the restaurant experience.This quarter, we made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our "For Real" campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there is a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients, and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.',
                 'CB': "Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.Thank you and welcome to our September 30, 2018, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially.Please see our most recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.Good morning. As a global insurer we experienced an active quarter for natural catastrophes around the world, but hardly on the same scale as the industry's record-breaking CAT events from the prior-year quarter. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb reported core operating income of $2.41 per share; excluding CATs and prior reserve development, we earned $2.82 per share, which compares to $2.68 prior year on the same basis, up over 5%.Overall, it was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by excellent underwriting results and strong investment income. Premium revenue growth was good in U.S. commercial P&C and particularly strong in our international P&C business, personal and commercial, as we benefited from a number of our growth initiatives. On the other hand, growth in our U.S. personal lines business was impacted by the onetime accounting action we described last quarter, which distorts the year-over-year comparison.P&C underwriting income of $669 million benefited from contributions from current accident year results and positive prior-year reserve releases. Our published P&C combined ratio was 90.9% which included 6 points of CAT. On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 88.2% versus 88.5% prior year; simply world-class. For your information, the current accident year combined ratio with an expected level of CATs was 92.8% versus 93% prior year.Net investment income of $883 million was driven by strong positive cash flow and higher reinvestment rates, which are beginning to benefit from an improving interest rate environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up about 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively, and were unfavorably impacted by FX. Phil will have more to say about book value, investment income, CATs, and prior-period development.Turning to growth and market conditions; for the company overall, Global P&C net premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, was 4% for the quarter in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on growth of about 0.5%. Excluding merger-related actions, growth was actually 4.5% in constant dollars. Merger-related actions are virtually behind us now.Commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote overall was similar to what we saw in the second quarter, and in fact better in many lines. As a general statement, pricing in the U.S. in particular was not keeping pace with loss cost trends in a number of important longer tail classes. All things being equal, this puts pressure on margins and serves as a natural governor on growth. For our company, this pressure is ameliorated to some degree in those lines by our ongoing underwriting portfolio actions and, overall, by our mix of business, i.e., we're emphasizing growth in other areas.In North America, rates overall were up about 2.5%, down marginally from last quarter's 3%. The difference was almost entirely a result of mix of business. At the same time, retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses, with the renewal retention as measured by premium, over 90%. Beginning with our major account retail and E&S wholesale division, premiums were up over 3.5%. Excluding merger-related underwriting actions, which are concentrated in this division, net premiums were up about 5.5%. Again, merger-related actions are now behind us with only about $20 million left for the fourth quarter.For major accounts, our renewal retention, as measured by premium in the quarter, was 92.7%. And for the business we wrote in major, rates overall were up 2%. The rate of increase for several important long-tail lines was higher than prior quarter, including casualty, management liability, and risk management; while the rate of increase for property was lower than the last few quarters.",
                 'CHD': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.Matthew Thomas Farrell - Church & Dwight Co., Inc.Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is finished, we'll open up the call for questions.Q3 was an outstanding quarter for our company. Q3 net sales grew 7.2% which reflects both strong organic sales growth and sales from prior year acquisitions. Sales growth is clearly a powerful earnings lever in an environment with rising input costs. Organic sales growth was 4.7% which exceeded our outlook of 3%. Global consumer organic net sales have accelerated sequentially over the last five quarters as price mix continues to improve. And this performance was a clear standout in comparison to our peers.Earnings per share was $0.58 which exceeded our outlook by $0.05. In the U.S. organic sales grew 4.7% with both volume growth and positive price. Our categories are growing and our market shares are healthy; 11 of our 15 categories grew during the quarter, 9 categories have grown for at least four consecutive quarters, and beyond category growth our share results are solid with 7 out of 11 power brands growing share. As we have said in the past, we have low exposure to private label, about 12% share on a weighted average basis. Now, we're having success in the online class of trade. Global consumer online sales continue to grow and we continue to expect it to exceed 6% of sales in 2018.With respect to the promotional environment, eight of our 11 power brands had a lower percentage of products sold on promotion in Q3 compared to Q3 2017 and still we grew. And this is the second quarter that we've seen this and we don't expect that to change in Q4.Our International Consumer business delivered 8.3% organic growth. As you know International has emerged as a growth driver for our company for the past four years. International markets are a bright spot for Church & Dwight, unlike many of our peers. Canada, Mexico and export had particularly strong quarters. The investments that we've made in new leadership, regional hubs, and our brand focus continue to pay off.On August 29, the company entered into a long-term cooperation agreement with Shanghai Jahwa a respected and well established local Chinese CPG company. Shanghai Jahwa will be the exclusive omni-channel distributor for four of our categories and they would be baking soda, toothpaste, dry shampoo and fem hy and this is in Mainland, China. This is an important step in our Asia-Pacific strategy and we're very excited about the partnership as Jahwa has demonstrated the ability to build strong brands for themselves and other CPG companies in the past in Mainland, China. Our algorithm is 6% annual organic growth for the international business and we expect to meet or beat that number in 2018.Now, turning to specialty products, Q3 was another challenging quarter for us with a 3.3% decline in organic sales. And this of course reflects lower demand for animal productivity products from our dairy customers who continue to be hurt by low milk prices. However, we still feel good about our long-term 5% organic sales algorithm, as a result of our acquisitions of businesses serving other species like cattle, swine and poultry.Now let's go back to the U.S. business for a moment to call out a couple of the big consumption winners in the quarter, in household ARM & HAMMER detergent reached an all-time high quarterly share of 10.3%, and ARM & HAMMER unit dose consumption grew 31%. In personal care, BATISTE continued to gain share with 33.5% consumption growth in the dry shampoo category while the category grew 26.7% in the quarter. BATISTE is the number one dry shampoo for the 11th consecutive quarter and continues to be the number one dry shampoo in the world.So to conclude, we had a terrific quarter. We have a sustainable evergreen business model because we have brand consumers' love, our company is a friend of the environment, and that is important both to us and to our consumers, and our people make Church & Dwight just a great place to work.",
                 'CI': "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's Third Quarter 2018 Results Review. At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode.We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.William McDowell - Cigna Corp.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's third quarter 2018 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018.As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of cigna.com.In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $138 million, or $0.56 per share, primarily to reflect the impact of merger-related transaction costs and a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results.Also, consistent with best practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018.With that, I will turn the call over to David.David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.Thanks, Will and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today I will begin by highlighting Cigna's outstanding third quarter 2018 financial results, which reflect substantial revenue and earnings growth and strength across each of our business segments. Next, I will discuss, how our ongoing effective execution of our strategy continues to drive Cigna's ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and how we will strengthen, broaden and accelerate our path forward through our combination of Express Scripts. Regarding our combination, I'll also provide a brief update on where we stand relative to the state regulatory approval process and our continued progress on integration planning.Finally, I'll share some initial thoughts regarding our expectations for 2019 before turning the call over to Eric who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing remarks.Turning to the third quarter, we once again delivered strong operating results with substantial revenue and earnings growth, strong retention, expansion and addition of new customer and client relationships and continued industry-leading medical cost trend.In the third quarter, our consolidated revenue grew by 9% to $11.5 billion, and our earnings per share increased by 36% to $3.84.We had strong performance across our businesses with Global Health Care delivering sustained strong revenue growth and exceptionally strong earnings growth; Global Supplemental Benefits delivered consistent revenue growth and solid earnings; and Group Disability and Life delivered meaningful earnings expansion, relative to third quarter 2017.Cigna's continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses through the first three quarters of 2018 gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.Looking more broadly at our performance, the marketplace continues to demand greater value through the right balance of affordability and personalization. At Cigna, we continue to be guided by Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond strategy to deliver differentiated value and invest in ongoing innovation. A demonstration of our success to-date is captured by our industry-leading medical cost trend, our outstanding customer and client retention, continued strong increases in Net Promoter Score results across our businesses, exceptional employee engagement levels and our ongoing commitment to community impact exemplified through our leadership in opioid use reduction and safety as well as overdose prevention.Further and consistent with our strategy, at Cigna we continue to innovate and invest for sustained value creation for the benefit of our customers, clients, partners and communities. We view innovation as a set of capabilities that puts the customer first, recognizes and values the crucial role of our partners, such as our health care professional partners and seeks to apply technologies which when coordinated can truly change lives.Our Diabetes Prevention Program is just one recent example of this. This program in collaboration with Omada Health delivers an expanded suite of personalized digital health tools to help prevent the onset of diabetes, as well as other chronic conditions.

                 'XEC': "I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Acierno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Karen Acierno - Cimarex Energy Co.Thanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. An updated Cimarex presentation was posted to our website yesterday, so we may be referring to this presentation during the call today.As a reminder, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements. A number of actions could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our disclosures on forward-looking statements on our news release and in our latest 10-Q for the three months ended September 30 which was filed yesterday and our 10-K and other filings for the risk factors associated with our business.So as always, we will begin our prepared remarks with an overview from our CEO, Tom Jorden, followed by an update on drilling activities, and results from John Lambuth. And then Joe Albi, COO, will update you on operations, including production and well costs. Our CFO, Mark Burford, is here to help answer any questions you may have.And as always so that we may accommodate more of your questions during the hour we have allotted to the call, we'd like to ask you that limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, feel free to get back in the queue if you like.And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.Thomas E. Jorden - Cimarex Energy Co.Thank you, Karen, and thank you to all who are joining us on the call this morning. We're pleased to report that Cimarex had a very good, active third quarter. We invested $500 million in exploration and development activities. $400 million of that was drilling and completion. We completed, flowed back and analyzed some important development projects which furthered our growing understanding of optimum economic development of our reservoirs. We are seeing excellent robust returns on our invested capital.As always, return on invested capital is our guide. Production growth is an outcome of our focus on returns, not a primary driver. Our net daily production averaged 218,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was above the high end of our guidance. We averaged 63,909 barrels of oil per day in the quarter which was in line with our guidance. Also, during the quarter, we closed the sale of our Ward County assets and further increased our dividend.We generated strong earnings and cash flow during the quarter and are on track to deliver solid performance during the fourth quarter of 2018 as well. Our definition of solid performance is very good return on invested capital underpinned by seamless field execution. As we complete the transition to development projects, field coordination and timing of multiple moving parts have increased the execution challenges. Our organization has adapted and risen to the challenge with few operational hiccups.Our production ramp continues. We brought 46 wells on line during the third quarter and expect another 34 to be on production by year-end, bringing the total to 119 wells for the year. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the Ward County sale, we project total production to increase 17% to 18% year-over-year with oil production set to increase 21% to 23% year-over-year. Furthermore, we project that our Q4 2018 oil production will increase 29% to 38% over Q4 2017.Most importantly, this production ramp is a result of a program that is generating outstanding returns. We have the economies of scale to deliver increasing capital efficiency and maintain an industry leading cost structure. Furthermore, we have great confidence that our assets and organization make these results highly repeatable. We are well-positioned for the environment ahead with decades of high quality inventory. We can compete with the best.As our program transitions to one that is dominated by large scale development and we transition to a more repeatable multi-year development pattern in 2020 and beyond, we think establishing a consistent program within cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders is a prudent approach that fits our business. Our experience tells us that capital programs that expand and contract with rising and falling commodity prices and cash flows leads to inefficiencies.Furthermore, these complex development projects require long lead time for planning, design, permitting and infrastructure. Effective execution requires a multi-year plan. Beginning in 2019, we will formulate our multi-year program budget around a flat NYMEX oil price. This will allow us to plan on consistent, repeatable programs that allow us to maintain and improve capital efficiency. We have the assets for it. We have the organization for it. And as we have demonstrated over the years, we have the discipline for it. Our strong consistent profitability is no accident.",
                 'CINF': "I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.Dennis McDanielHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor Web site cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is a quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer, and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating in the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenback; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, J.F. Scherer; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; Senior Vice President of Commercial Lines, Steve Spray; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Financial, Teresa Hopper.First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore does not reconcile to GAAP.Now, I will turn the call over to Steve.Steve JohnstonGood morning. And thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Net income for the third quarter of 2018 was more than five times the same period a year ago. Approximately three quarters of the growth in net income again reflected variability related to this year’s new accounting requirement for changes in the fair value of equity securities. About one eighth of the increase was from other non-recurring items generally related to taxes, and Mike will comment further on that in a moment. The remaining growth in net income largely reflects improved underwriting results despite higher catastrophe losses and is reflected by our improving property casualty combined ratio and 41% growth in non-GAAP operating income.Our 96.8% combined ratio for the third quarter of this year was 2.5 points better than year ago. And is the result of several factors, including ongoing benefits of diversifying our business in recent years. Our commercial line segment experienced another good quarter with a combined ratio of near 95%. Importantly, we’re seeing signs of improvement in paid loss cost trends for our commercial casualty line of business. The paid ratio for the first nine months of 2018 was almost 2 percentage points lower than the same period a year ago.While we’re currently maintaining a prudent amount of IBNR reserve for that line, particularly for accident year 2018, we were comfortable with releasing some reserves for all the accident years, largely accident years 2016 and prior. We continue to take a careful approach to growing our commercial lines business and targeting underwriting actions, slowed net written premium growth to 1% on the nine month basis.Overall, commercial lines' estimated average price increases for the third quarter were slightly higher than the first half of 2018, including higher average pricing for our commercial casualty line of business. Our excess and surplus line segment continues to perform very well with third quarter and year-to-date combined ratios in the low 70s. It is reported 24 straight quarters of combined ratios below 100%. Excess and surplus lines' premiums are also growing at a healthy rate in the double digit range for the third quarter and first nine months of this year.Our personal line segment in Cincinnati Re were affected by significant levels of weather-related catastrophe losses, experiencing third quarter combined ratios a little over 100%. Cincinnati Re remains profitable for the full year and inception to-date. Our personal line segment continued to experience a rise in average rate increases. The third quarter 2018 average was a little higher than the second quarter with personal auto again near the high end of the high single digit range. Both of these areas of our business continue to grow at healthy rates, and we anticipate better underwriting results in future quarters.Throughout our property-casualty operations, we continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on policies where our models and judgment indicate that's needed as we segment accounts through careful underwriting of various risks. That segmentation is not always reflected in the average renewal price increases we report. However, when the benefits of segmentation combined with rising reported average renewal price increases as they did this quarter, it can significantly enhance our overall profitability.",
                 'C': " We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.Ms. Kendall, you may begin.Susan KendallThank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we’ll be happy to take questions.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today’s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Mike CorbatThank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018 or $1.73 per share. We continue to see solid growth this quarter in many areas, including our accrual businesses and ICG, fixed income, and Mexico Consumer and despite a drag from net one-time gains that affected our top line comparisons, we still achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, driving our efficiency ratio down to 56.1%.Loans and deposits, both grew year-over-year and our return on assets increased to 95 basis points. We're on track to achieve our 2018 financial target, on a year-to-date basis we've generated 4% underlying growth in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses. Our efficiency ratio is 57.3% and we achieved a return on tangible common equity of 11.2%, keeping us on track to exceed our original target of 10.5% for the full year.We returned $6.4 billion of capital to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the quarter and over the past 12 months, we've reduced our common shares outstanding by over $200 million or 8%. Combined with our operating performance, our earnings per share were 22% higher than one year ago.Turing to the businesses, in Global Consumer Banking, we saw solid growth in Mexico, even when you back out the gain on the sale of our asset management business. In Asia, we saw some headwinds in our more market sensitive investment products. But the remainder of the franchise showed consistent growth. And in the U.S., we're starting to see the impact of the L.L. Bean portfolio and retail services where revenue continued to grow.Branded Cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year. Our Institutional Clients Group grew by 4%, excluding a one-time gain from last year. Fixed Income and equities were up 7% in total and as in the past our accrual businesses, TTS Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank all showed strong year-over-year growth. Investment banking was down versus last year as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry. The client dialogues remained solid and we feel good about the pipeline and upcoming transactions.During the quarter, we also made some changes to make certain our structure is completely aligned with our strategic goals. In North America, we shifted to the same regional model we have in Asia and Latin America and have asked Anand Selva to run what is our largest consumer market. His experience in Asia where we operate a client centric franchise with strong digital adoption will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale in credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.In ICG, we’re combining corporate and investment banking with capital markets origination, by integrating advisory services with capital raising, we believe we will ensure an even greater focus on our clients. And Paco Ybarra will become Jamie Forese’s deputy, giving Paco a platform to focus on technology and capital optimization across our institutional businesses.And as you know, several senior leaders at our firm have decided to retire among them John Gerspach, but the good news is, is this isn’t your last call with John since he won’t be leaving until we file our 2018 financial statements.With that John, I’ll turn it over to you to go through the presentation and then we’re happy to take questions.John GerspachThanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, net income of $4.6 billion in the third quarter grew 12% from last year. Largely driven by a lower effective tax rate and EPS grew 22%, including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.4 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, reflecting the net impact of one-time gain in the third quarters of both 2017 and 2018, as well as FX translation. ",
                 'CFG': "I’d now like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.Ellen TaylorThanks so much, Brad, and hello everyone. We really appreciate you joining us today. We’re going to start things off with prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, he will review our third quarter results, and then we're going to open up the call for questions. We’re also really happy to have in the room with us today Brad Conner, who's Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking.In addition to our release, we have a presentation and financial supplement available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are absolutely subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ from expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K we filed today. We also need to remind you that we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and our material.And with that, I'm going to give it over to Bruce.Bruce Van SaunOkay thanks, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter today, paced by strong top line growth of 7% excluding FAMC, Franklin and good expense discipline which combines for positive operating leverage of 4.4% year on year. And we continue to achieve good balance sheet growth in the current environment with sequential loan growth excluding FAMC of 1% and year over year growth of 4%. That's a very good result considering we're still running off non-core assets and reducing our auto and leasing portfolios.We've focused on some great niches, on the consumer side, and we've invested in broader coverage on the commercial side to achieve this growth. Our strong execution to-date in 2018 has led to some very nice improvement in key metrics. EPS growth year on year is 37% underlying and 34% on a year to date basis. Our ROTCE reached 13.5% underlying which is into our target range of 13 to 15% and the efficiency ratio was 58% underlying. We are confident in our Q4 outlook and we expect to finish the year strong.Our capital strength continues to be a real advantage as we have the capacity to grow our balance sheet and drive organic growth to make small smart key based acquisitions and to return significant capital to our shareholders which we did and exceeded 500 million in the current quarter. We've had a couple of great slides in the deck today covering our progress against our strategic initiatives and some of the recognitions we've been garnering.I've just crossed my five year mark at Citizens and I feel really good about how we've been able to turn around the bank and shift from defense to offense. We now have a clear view of what it will take to be successful longer term and become a fast performing bank, and we're making significant investments to position us well for the future. That said, we understand the need to deliver consistently strong and improving results each quarter, and I feel our team has done a great job of getting that balance right.So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, to take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color, John.John WoodsThanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. We delivered another strong quarter that highlights steady execution against their enterprise level initiatives with particular focus on robust positive operating leverage. We continued our momentum in delivering cost efficiencies while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success.Some quick highlights, we grew our underlying EPS 37% year on year. We delivered operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition, which closed on August 1. We continue to make progress on improving returns with underlying ROTCE for the quarter of 13.5%, up nearly 60 basis points linked quarter and 340 basis points year-over-year.Our consumer and commercial banking segments are delivering improved returns by driving prudent balance sheet growth and controlling our deposit costs in a very competitive environment, across both business segments we are growing our customer base, deepening relationships, running our capabilities and investing in new technologies to enhance the customer experience. I'll expand on our strategic initiatives a little later.On Slide 3, we provide information on the Franklin American acquisition and related integration costs, and in order to make it easier to see underlying trends, we show you our results without the integration costs and provide further color on our result, excluding Franklin on Slide 4 and 5. As I mentioned, you can see that we delivered positive operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of Franklin with an efficiency ratio of 57%. Also, PPNR growth year-over-year was 13% excluding Franklin.On Page 6, net interest margin results came in as expected with a two basis points increase excluding the impact of Franklin even though average LIBOR rose less than anticipated. We are pleased that despite a fairly competitive landscape, we continue to drive disciplined balance sheet growth and delivered a 2% sequential quarter increase in net interest income.",
                 'CTXS': "Dawn Morris - Citrix Systems, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for today's third quarter 2018 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Drew Del Matto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation is being webcast on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website. And the webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Securities Law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Obviously, these risks can cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.Furthermore, we'll discuss various non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.Now, I'd like to turn it over to Drew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Drew?Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.Thank you, Dawn. And welcome to everyone joining us today.Our transition to the cloud continues to gain momentum, driving our Q3 revenue growth rate, which about doubled over last year. Financial highlights include revenue grew 6% year-over-year, led by subscription revenue growth of 37% year-on-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 32%. Adjusted EPS was $1.40 per share, up 16% versus last year. And cash flow from operations was $301 million, a Q3 record, growing 18% over last year.Q3 was the typical back-end loaded quarter due to summertime seasonality around the world. This impacted the timing of revenue from cloud and subscription transactions, the bulk of which closed in late September. The result was a deceleration in the subscription revenue growth rate from our second quarter. We expect subscription revenue to reaccelerate in Q4, as we'll see a full quarter of revenue from our September transactions, plus the benefit of a typically more linear bookings quarter.Our Q3 enterprise business was solid, as we closed 55 $1 million-plus transactions, with concentration in healthcare, technology, and government sectors. We saw strength in our cloud and subscription offerings across our portfolio, particularly in Workspace Services as customers embrace our future of work vision, driving higher productivity and employee engagement. All of our geographies grew at a consistent rate, with the transition of enterprises to our subscription offerings strong across all regions.Citrix cloud simplified hybrid cloud adoption, providing the same infrastructure on-premise or in the cloud. Customers are realizing the value of reduced infrastructure complexity, better overall user experience, increased security, faster access to innovation, and flexibility to align with their business initiative.Next, let's take a closer look at Q3 results within our primary businesses. Workspace Services maintained its momentum, growing 7% year-over-year to $462 million. This was driven by a continuation of recent trends towards our unified workspace and TFP (04:29) offerings. Within Workspace Services subscriptions were roughly half of the total Workspace product bookings mix in Q3. We also saw stable results in the Networking business. Networking revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $195 million in Q3, with subscription revenue increasing 95% over the last year. This reflects strength of our hybrid cloud offerings, providing the flexibility, performance and visibility as enterprises anticipate and execute their cloud strategies.Finally, our Content Collaboration revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. As we discussed over the past year, ShareFile is becoming more of an integrated file sync and sharing solution for our enterprise Workspace customers, moving away from its prior focus on just the standalone F&B space. As such, the reporting of the Content Collaboration results will be integrated within our Workspace business during 2019. We'll provide more details on our Q4 2018 earnings call.Let's now turn to operations. Our adjusted operating margin was 32% in Q3. We'll continue to balance expanding our profitability with the investments needed to support growing pipeline and sales capacity as we transition the business model. As mentioned, cash flow from operations was $301 million, up 18%, bringing our trailing 12-month cash flow to $1.1 billion. Deferred and unbilled revenue combined grew $187 million, or 11% over last year. Unbilled subscription revenue grew nearly 330% or $140 million versus Q3 of last year. Deferred revenue was $1.68 billion in Q3 of 2018. Please note that the adoption of the new Revenue Accounting Standard, ASC 606, creates about a 300 basis point headwind that you will need to adjust for when comparing deferred and unbilled revenue for Q3 2018 to Q3 2017.",
                 'CLX': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lisah Burhan, Managing Director of Investor Relations for The Clorox Company. Ms. Burhan, you may begin your conference.Lisah Burhan - The Clorox Co.Thanks, Stephanie. Welcome, everyone. On the call with me today are Benno Dorer, our Chairman and CEO, and Kevin Jacobsen, our CFO. We're broadcasting this call over the Internet, and a replay of the call will be available for seven days at our website, thecloroxcompany.com.On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, free cash flow, EBIT margin, debt to EBITDA, and economic profit. Management believes that providing insights on these measures enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations.Reconciliations with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, this webcast's prepared remarks or supplemental information available on our website as well as in our SEC filings. In particular, it may be helpful to refer to tables located at the end of today's earnings release.Please also recognize that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes could differ materially from management's expectations and plans. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation.Please review our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC and our other SEC filings for a description of important factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.With that, let me cover our Q3 performance, discussing highlights in each one of our segments. Kevin will then address our financial results as well as updated outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, Benno will offer his perspective and we'll close with Q&A.For the total company, Q3 volume and sales each grew 3%. We grew sales in all four segments, offsetting nearly a point of negative impact from Aplicare divestiture. These results were on top of very strong growth in the year-ago quarter when volume increased 7% and sales grew 4%.Now, I'll turn to our results by segment. In our Cleaning segment, Q3 volume grew 4%, where sales grew 3%. Cleaning segment top line growth was led by Home Care, where volume and sales each grew by high-single digits on top of double-digit volume and sales growth in the year-ago quarter. Volume in Home Care was broad based with record quarterly shipments of several Clorox-branded products, including Clorox disinfecting wipes.Following implementation of recent price increase, our disinfecting wipes business still reported double-digit volume growth, emphasizing the strength of the Clorox brand. Contributing to the growth were gains from new product innovation, strong merchandising as well as shipments related to a severe cold and flu season. Consistent with these results, Home Care delivered its 15th consecutive quarter of market share gains.In our Laundry business, volume and sales declined, primarily due to softness in the sodium hypochlorite bleach category. At the same time, as we trade consumers up to higher dollaring items in this category, as well as other bleach-based product in our Home Care business, we're pleased to see continued share gains in Clorox liquid bleach behind our premium Clorox Splash-Less Bleach as well as the launch of new Clorox Performance Bleach with CLOROMAX.Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our Professional Products sales declined due to the Aplicare divestiture which occurred in August 2017. Excluding the impact of Aplicare, sales grew double digits from new product innovation, strong e-commerce growth and incremental shipments of cleaning products behind the cold and flu season.Turning to Household segment, Q3 volume grew 3% and sales grew 1%, with growth in Cat Litter, largely offset by a decline in cold due to poor weather throughout the quarter. Starting with our Cat Litter business, volume and sales grew double digits, driven by core strength in the business as well as our new Clean Paws innovations, which we're now also supporting with a national marketing campaign. This business continued to have strong momentum behind our Fresh Step with Febreze innovation platform and this was our sixth consecutive quarter of market share growth.In our Glad bags and wraps business, volume and sales grew, primarily driven by strong trash bag volume in the club channel. Consistent with our strategy on this business, we saw all-time record shipments of our premium OdorShield offerings, reflecting our focus on driving profitable growth in this higher margin segment.In February, we turned on advertising for our new ForceFlex Plus Advanced Protection trash bags, which featured a reinforced bottom, leak guard technology, superior strength and guaranteed seven-day odor control. In our Charcoal business, volume and sales decreased, driven by the coldest and snowiest January through March in the last several years. Simply put, it was the snowiest March in 25 years which is certainly not favorable for Charcoal, especially in early spring. This issue negatively impact the entire Charcoal category, driving consumption down double digits for the quarter.For perspective, this resulted in nearly 1 point of negative impact to our total company sales in Q3. Since then, we've seen a challenging start to the Charcoal business in Q4, given retailer inventory carryover from Q3, as well as the continuation of poor weather into April. That said, we're focused on executing our plans for our fourth and largest quarter of the year. We're leaning into new partnership with Major League Baseball, turning on our marketing programs for the grilling season and we're working with our retail partners to add additional in-store events notably around key holidays.",
                 'CME': "John Peschier - CME Group, Inc.Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us today. And we're going to start with the Safe Harbor language. Then, I'll turn it over to Terry for some brief remarks, followed by your questions. Other members of our management team are here also and will participate in the Q&A session.Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

Duffy - CME Group, Inc.Thanks, John, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. I hope you got a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter. So, let me share a few of those highlights. The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3, as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year.At CME, we saw particular strength in treasuries, equities, emerging market, FX futures and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals.More importantly, we gained traction in new offerings, including our SOFR and SONIA interest rate futures contracts. We saw rising volume in open interest, as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector futures in September. We set new daily records in the new monthly FX futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September.Within our commodities complex, we announced a Q4 launch date for physically-delivered WTI Houston Crude Oil Futures contracts. This helps reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract.In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume (00:02:39) also records in our Livestock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort.In September, we launched a new interactive CME Liquidity Tool to help market participants analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid-ask spreads, book depth and cost to trade statistics across the CME asset classes.Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities. CME's new Liquidity Tool has attracted a large amount of interest from clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website, and I encourage all of you to take a quick look at it.We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ futures license through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading Equity Index complex.Finally, with respect to our next transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved – with the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before the – before yearend. We have been working diligently over the last few months on the high-level integration planning with the NEX team.Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier, and it's nice to see interest rates equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far with the other four product areas growing just as well.With that short summary, I'd like to open up the call for your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you very much. Our first question will come from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe can you just talk a little bit about the equities complex did you see the RPC drop (00:05:10) in that area a little more than we expected, if you can talk about the development of some of the new contracts. It looks like, as you outlined (00:05:22) Bitcoin was only about 3% of that. I mean, it was a very good development but it's only about 3% of the total equities line. So, I don't know if that had any influence on the RPC (00:05:35) would have thought actually would have been positive. Maybe if you can just address those drivers.",
                 'CMS': "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Srikanth Maddipati - CMS Energy Corp.Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.Now I'll turn the call over to Patti.Patricia K. Poppe - CMS Energy Corp.Thanks, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us on our call today. We're looking forward to Halloween next week but there are no tricks here, only treat, our predictable financial results. With that I'll begin with an overview and a focus on our triple bottom line and Rejji will follow up with more details on our financial results and outlook. With another great quarter behind us, we're pleased to report adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share to the first nine months of the year, which are up 16% from our 2017 results. We're also pleased to announce that we're raising the bottom end of our full year guidance by $0.01 with 2018 adjusted earnings guidance now at $2.31 to $2.34 per share, which further demonstrates our confidence in our ability to deliver again this year, giving us our 16th year of consistent industry-leading financial performance.Now as I've stated previously, when we moved to 6% to 8% growth from 5% to 7%, we were signaling that we raised the midpoint of our range from 6% to 7%, showing our confidence in continuing to deliver 7% as we have for 15 years in a row. Last year, we delivered a strong 7% which was towards the high end of our 6% to 8% 2017 guidance, so we would be disappointed if we did not deliver towards the high end of our guidance again this year. We're also initiating 2019 adjusted earnings guidance at $2.46 to $2.50 per share which reflects 6% to 8% growth, no resets or surprises here. As we typically do, we'll revisit our guidance based on our actual results during our fourth quarter earnings call. And we're reaffirming our long-term goal of 6% to 8% with a bias towards the midpoint.Slide 5 is a great reminder of how much work we're doing day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year to provide the consistent financial results you've come to expect. We focus on prioritizing reinvestment opportunities in periods where we experienced better than expected cost performance or weather benefits like we've seen throughout this year. In times like we saw last year with poor weather and significant storm activity, we'll rely on our lean operating system and our ability to optimize work to maximize safety and reliability for the benefit of our customers. Since 2013 we've reinvested millions of dollars at the utility, such as low income support of $24 million that helps our most vulnerable customers catch up on energy bills during hard times and reduces risk in our uncollectible accounts for all of our other customers.Right now we remain focused on the work that can be done this year to de-risk next year while providing immediate benefits to customers such as tree trimming in the electric business where we expect to spend $54 million and our gas pipeline integrity and reliability program where we'll spend around $37 million this year. This strategy allows us to deliver on our financial results this year while providing a longer runway for us to deliver the growth you have all come to expect in the coming years. The blue line that you see on slide 5 represents the volatility that we manage year after year to ensure that you continue to experience consistent financial results shown by that straight as an arrow green line. In short, we ride the rollercoaster so you don't have to.Our gas business is a perfect example of our triple bottom line thinking. We commit to a safe and reliable gas system, one of the largest in the country with over 28,000 miles of distribution mains and nearly 1,700 miles of transmission lines, to serve our 1.8 million gas customers. We protect our customers and the planet with every dollar we invest in our system. Our investment in the gas system will be about half of our total capital plan over the next five years. That's the triple bottom line in action. The skilled workforce serving our gas customers is a critical enabler to our ability to execute our plan.Not that long ago, we couldn't find qualified candidates for many of the positions we needed to fill, so we started our veteran boot camp in 2016. Today (00:06:00), Consumers Energy has hired 116 gas workers from the program with a 94% retention rate. It's a three-week training program followed by a 90-day internship and then full time job offers. The program accounts for 47% of the talent hired into that role over the last three years. This program is far more successful than the previous hiring plans, where we typically saw a 50% failure rate for the physical dig assessment (00:06:27) which eliminated the candidate from further consideration. In fact, earlier this month, I was at our new employee orientation and I asked for all the veterans in the room to stand. I was overwhelmed to see that over half the room was filled with those who have served our country. I am so proud to have these veterans on our team and putting their skills and knowledge to work for our company and our customers.",
                 'KO': "At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call.Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with our cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.We posted schedules under the Financial Reports & Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion, to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they are referring to comparable performance from continuing operations.Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue.Now, let me turn the call over to James.James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've had another solid quarter that has included a number of notable developments, from M&A to changes in our leadership team. And I'll come to all of that shortly, but let me start by focusing on our quarter and our year to-date performance.We are gaining share in a growing industry. Industry growth has improved from last year, driven by better results across both developed and emerging markets. Some large emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, are clearly doing better. Others like Argentina, South Africa and the Middle East, are not doing so well. But collectively, we are seeing solid results.We've been capturing more than our fair share of growth as we've continued to execute on our transformation as a total beverage company. And notably, the industry has seen better performance within the global sparkling soft drink category, delivering both volume and value growth year-to-date.Turning to our operational performance, we are managing our business well across key dimensions. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by strength across all operating segments. Unit case volume is up 2%, led by Trademark Coca-Cola, which grew 3% globally. Comparable EPS is up 8% year-to-date, in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% for the full year.This is despite significantly stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. We accomplished this through a combination of top-line growth and productivity initiatives as driving underline margin expansion even as we continue to invest back in the marketing and face a rising cost environment.Finally, our top and bottom-line growth is broad-based. Developed markets have grown organic revenues low single digits year-to-date, and our emerging and developing markets have grown double digits year-to-date.Turning to our geographic performance in the quarter, in EMEA, we grew organic revenue 9%, benefiting from solid operational price/mix as well as from geographic mix. During the quarter, we saw strong growth across Europe, driven by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea and innocent, all helped by good weather.In some of the emerging and developing markets like Turkey and the Middle East, the macroeconomic environment is tough, but ongoing packaging and pricing initiatives are helping us deliver solid revenue growth while staying affordable.Turning to Asia Pacific, despite cycling a more difficult comparison period, strong performance in China and India drove another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. In Japan, a solid innovation pipeline was overshadowed by natural disasters in July and September, which included a flood that destroyed a production facility for our bottler, impacting our capacity. Looking ahead, we'll continue working closely with our bottler to minimize the impact and protect our position in the market.In Latin America, we delivered 19% organic revenue growth for the quarter as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid a variety of macroeconomic environments. Now worth noting, 9 points of that growth is due to the timing of concentrate shipments in Brazil, which will reverse out in the fourth quarter. However, even after adjusting for this timing element, we still delivered double-digit top-line growth in the quarter.",
                 'CTSH': "I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice-President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir.David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q to be filed later today.I would like now to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco.Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics: first, a few highlights from Q3, and second, since we're about two weeks away from Cognizant's Investor Day, I thought I'd give you a preview on what we'll be discussing.Let's begin with the quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.08 billion, within our guided range and up 8.3% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments delivered a strong performance in the quarter driven largely by the increasing adoption of digital across these segments. And in the fourth segment, banking and financial services, we see good growth in our digital offerings, which continues to be offset by pressure on run-the-bank spending. As a result, our digital revenue in the quarter grew in the low 20% range, well above company average and now over 30% of total revenue, reflecting the continuing shift across segments to digital revenues. Underscoring the relevance of our industry-specific digital services to clients, we continue to see our digital portfolio generate margins above the company average.Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.1% for the quarter, putting us on track to deliver on our full-year margin commitment. And quarterly non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. As these results suggest, our sustained emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins and deliver higher quality growth as clients shift more of their spending from traditional IT to digital services. Turning to guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. For the full year, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16.09 billion and $16.13 billion, a growth of 8.6% to 9%, and we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%.Over the last couple of months, we have announced three acquisitions to further enhance our digital capabilities. Two of them, which closed earlier this month, relate to the Salesforce Platform where Cognizant has one of the industry's largest roster of certified consultants. We acquired Advanced Technology Group, which provides customer and revenue management consulting and implementation services that are focused on the Salesforce Platform. Advanced Technology Group, headquartered in the U.S., has expertise in implementing automated, cloud-based Quote-to-Cash business processes, a new and fast growing part of the Salesforce ecosystem. Their capabilities will strengthen our cloud solutions portfolio as clients shift to business models based on recurring revenue streams.During the quarter, we also acquired SaaSfocus, one of the largest independent Salesforce Platinum consulting partners in the Asia-Pacific region with operations across Australia and India. SaaSfocus will expand our end-to-end digital transformation services and Salesforce cloud capabilities in Asia-Pacific. We're especially excited about the anticipated acquisition of Softvision announced earlier this month, which will expand our digital engineering capabilities once completed. Softvision is a leader in software product innovation and development using modern agile software engineering tools, techniques, and processes. Softvision will bring more than 2,800 technologists to Cognizant, increasing our ability to provide software engineering services to our clients from a new Eastern European base in Romania, a fast emerging hub for software developers. We expect the acquisition to close later this quarter.Adding Softvision to Cognizant will enable us to create one of the world's largest digital engineering companies. Our acquisition activity complements our ongoing organic investment in digital capabilities, domain knowledge, global and local delivery, and overall ability to deliver for clients from strategy through implementation and outcomes.",
                 'CL': 'Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.John FaucherThank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer.Today’s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate’s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate’s website.Ian CookGood morning, everyone. This is Ian, and I’d like to make some introductory comments. You will recall from our previous quarterly earnings call that we talked in some depth and with some urgency around our focus on innovation and building growth in channels where people are shopping, and our commitment to advertising and continuing to derive efficiency and capabilities. And I do not intend today to dwell on those areas. What I intend to focus on is what was a challenging and disappointing quarter for us.Challenging on two levels. First, foreign exchange, which moved sharply negative, particularly so in our large Latin American division; and secondly, the underlying growth in commodity costs, partly affected by the transaction impact of foreign exchange. Underlying materials were up over 8%; oil, as you know, was up 46% quarter-on-quarter. And as you will hear from John, who will go forward, our margin roll forward, raw and packing materials this quarter were 390 basis points negative impact against gross margin. And from both material and foreign exchange points of view, we expect that pressure to continue in the fourth quarter. And that is why, we took the pricing that we did in the third, which we spoke to about in the second quarter, and pricing will continue to be an area of necessary focus going forward, as you have heard from some of our competitors quite recently. The disappointing part of this earnings report is the weak top-line, for 6 divisions up, but with Brazil in Latin America and China in Asia drove our top-line from positive to negative.So, let me start with Brazil. In Brazil, the macroeconomics are volatile, including a hangover from the trucker strike in the second quarter. And of course, less now, but still uncertainty around the elections. The categories, as you’ve heard from others, in our principal businesses, turned negative in the third quarter, both in volume and in value. We took pricing early as we said we would, and we have not yet seen retail pricing move up or competitors for our pricing lead. And as you know and as you have heard from others as well, in situations like this, often there is a gap between the lead and moving price and competitors following. We have obviously therefore seen a volume impact negatively because of the pricing we took. And we reported, you may recall, less of a negative impact from the trucker strike in the second quarter than our competitors, and that may also have affected our third quarter performance a little bit as well.Our market shares continue to hold in well, up year-to-date and holding through our leading pricing action. And our plans going forward remain the same. We are sticking with our commitment to pricing. And we do expect inflation to return to the categories. We’re launching the premium new products that we said we would, in the pharmacy channel, OrthoGard and PerioGard off to a good start; elmex just starting to ship right now. And Naturals in toothpaste and Personal Care moving to the marketplace. And of course, as we announced at Barclays and this applies globally, we have the relaunch of our scale core Total business beginning worldwide in the first quarter and for Brazil particularly where this is a 17 share business, it will have a favorable impact on growth going forward.We, I must say, take on Brazil, a more guarded view than we have heard from others given the situation we see in our categories. But, if I would offer a glimmer of light, it is fair to say when we look at our category data, accessing the third quarter, the declines we saw were easing, which hopefully augurs well as we go forward.China is a different set of circumstances. We remain positive on China. There is growth in the category, and our volume share of 34% has held constant over a good number of years. Our value share, slightly lower, represents the area of opportunity as we have spoken about, because there are two big things going on in China. Number one is the premiumization of categories, led by some of the local brands that we have spoken about; and the second is a very big change in consumption patterns and shopping environment with the explosion of e-commerce in the country.',
                 'CMCSA': "I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.Jason S. Armstrong - Comcast Corp.Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone.As always, let me now refer you to slide number 2, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer, and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.Turning to today's materials, we'll be doing things a bit differently with two segments to this call. First, as usual, Brian Roberts and Mike Cavanagh will make prepared remarks covering our third quarter earnings, after which they will be joined by Steve Burke and Dave Watson for a Q&A session related to our results. Then, we will move to a discussion of our recent acquisition of Sky with Jeremy Darroch, the CEO of Sky, joining Brian for a slide presentation, followed by Q& A.With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts to review our third quarter 2018 results. Brian?Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corp.Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone.This is a really exciting time for our company, as we are so pleased to have completed the acquisition of Sky, and today we look forward to talking more about that, which we'll do in a little bit. But let me first turn to our strong third quarter results and the many key achievements that I'd like to highlight.Cable's EBITDA growth of 7.6% was the fastest in six years, and net cash flow increased by 15.6%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This impressive financial performance reflects the pivot we've made to our connectivity businesses, which have higher margins and lower capital intensity.In addition, we surpassed 30 million customer relationships, as year-over-year growth accelerated to over 3%. Customer relationship net adds of 288,000 were driven by 363,000 net new broadband customers, the best third quarter in 10 years. Collectively, residential broadband and Business Services revenue increased by nearly 10%. These results demonstrate that customers love our products.We are investing to harness the capacity and capabilities of our network and deliver innovative differentiated experiences, which we believe gives us a long runway for further growth. We are competing really well in residential broadband by offering customers the fastest speeds, most reliable Wi-Fi coverage in the home, and industry-leading Wi-Fi management and controls. We've branded our holistic broadband product as xFi, and continue to add new features, and we're rolling out our xFi gateways and pods to further enhance the service.We also recently announced that our 1-gig Internet is now available to nearly all of the 58 million homes and businesses passed in our footprint. This is the fastest deployment of gigabit speeds to the most locations in the country by anybody. It's a similar story in Business Services, with demand for our connectivity across small, medium, and enterprise customers driving double-digit growth.Led by our X1 platform, video plays an important supporting role in our strategy of driving whole-home economics and providing the best value and experience to customers, and we remain committed to competing for video subscribers we can serve profitably. By aggregating and integrating everything from linear TV to applications like Netflix, YouTube, and soon Amazon Prime Video, X1 deliveries an unmatched user experience and the broadest range of content that underscores the value of our broadband service.Our newest addition to the bundle, Xfinity Mobile, is also resonating with customers. In little over a year, we've crossed 1 million customer lines. Customers who subscribe to Xfinity Mobile have overall higher satisfaction, and our early results indicate that adding mobile improves broadband customer retention, one of our key objectives.Another success that I'm proud of is the progress we've made in improving the customer experience. Over the last 12 months, customer satisfaction scores have increased, and we have taken out 16 million calls handled by our agents and reduced truck rolls by over 1 million year over year while adding nearly 1 million customer relationships. What's enabled us to do this is our transformation of the way customers interact with us. Over 75% of the interactions are now being completed through our digital touch points. Providing more digital tools remains the key focus as we go forward, and that will help take additional operating costs out of the business.Now turning to NBCUniversal, Cable Networks and Broadcast TV EBITDA collectively increased by 6% in the third quarter, reflecting growth across retrans and affiliate revenues, content licensing, and advertising. Some highlights from the recently completed 52-week season included NBC Broadcast finishing number one in total viewers for the first time in 16 years, along with our win among adults 18 to 49 for the fifth consecutive year in prime, and Telemundo's second consecutive win among adults 18 to 49 in Spanish language prime.The new season is off to a great start as well. Both networks continue to lead the competition, and NBC holds four out of the top 10 shows in prime, the most among the broadcasters, as well as two of the top three new premieres this season with Manifest and New Amsterdam. Thanks to Bob Greenblatt for building this momentum, and we're excited with George Cheeks and Paul Telegdy, who are off to a great start.At Cable Networks, MSNBC had an outstanding quarter once again, with record ratings resulting in its largest lead ever over CNN in key dayparts. As these results demonstrate, we have the right TV content with more ways to monetize it than ever before.At Film, we had record profitability in last year's third quarter, thanks to Despicable Me 3. While this year was lower without a comparable animated film, it was still a healthy quarter, with successful theatrical results from Jurassic World, Mamma Mia, and other films. We are looking forward to 2019 and beyond, when we will see a ramp up to multiple animated releases from Illumination and DreamWorks, as well as the return of some of our best franchises.Finally, at Theme Parks, our park in Japan experienced multiple unprecedented weather events and natural disasters that impacted results, as Mike will cover in more detail. Our thoughts are with those many in Japan who were affected by these devastating typhoons and earthquakes.",
                 'CMA': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Darlene PersonsThank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to the Comerica’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on SEC’s website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.This conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today’s release in Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ. [Audio Gap] after this conference call we’ll reference non-GAAP measures and, in that regard, I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.Now I’ll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.Ralph BabbGood morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $318 million or $1.86 per share, excluding $20 million in security losses revenue grew 2%.Our credit metrics remain strong and expenses were well controlled. This drove an ROE of over 16% and an ROA of 1.77% for the quarter. Relative to the third quarter of last year our earnings per share increased 48% and net income is up 41%. This increase is due to our management of loan and deposit pricing, as interest rates have moved higher, improved credit quality and continued successful execution of our GEAR Up initiatives, as well as a lower tax rate.On Slide 4, we have provided details on the adjustments related to certain items. We realized $23 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to the 2017 tax reform law. The bulk of the proceeds were used to reposition a portion of our securities portfolio into treasuries which yield about $4 million in additional interest per quarter. The repositioning resulted in a loss in the securities sold. We also incurred restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiatives.Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of our third quarter results, a seasonal decline in National Dealer Services and typical summer slowdown in middle market contributed to a $641 million decline in average loans compared to the second quarter. This was partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker and continued growth in Technology and Life Sciences, specifically equity fund services.As far as deposits average balances increased $263 million. Our deposit rate increased 9 basis points as we remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing to attract and retain customers.Net interest income increased $9 million with the net benefit from increased interest rates contributing $13 million. Our net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 3.60% as the benefit of rates rising was offset by lower non-accrual interest recoveries and higher excess liquidity.We continue to have strong credit quality with a decline in problem loans and 13 basis points in net charge-offs. The charge- offs for the quarter were fully covered by our existing allowance, and as a result there was no provision for loan losses.Non-interest income increased $6 million or over 2% excluding the $20 million in losses on securities that I previously mentioned. We have maintained our expense discipline and our efficiency ratio dropped to just under 53%.Now that we are no longer subject to CCAR, our board is able to more efficiently and effectively take capital actions with a focus on reducing our robust capital ratios to a level that is reflective of our business strategy.In the third quarter, we meaningfully increased our payoff to shareholders to a record level. We repurchased $500 million in shares and increased our dividend 76% to $0.60 per share. Our estimated CET1 capital ratio decreased 23 basis points to 11.66%.And now I will turn the call over to Muneera, who will go over the quarter in more detail.Muneera CarrThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Third quarter average loans declined $641 million compared to the second quarter primarily due to seasonality.Our auto dealer portfolio decreased $400 million. Dealers typically reduced inventory in the third quarter in preparation for delivery of the new models.",
                 'CAG': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.Brian KearneyGood morning, everyone. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. While we are making those statements in good faith and we are confident about the Company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, we refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language.Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. References to adjusted items including organic net sales refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Please see the press release for additional information on our comparability items. The reconciliations of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either of the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found on our website at ConAgrabrands.com/investor-relations.Now, I'll turn it over to Sean.Sean ConnollyThanks, Brian. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. We continued to make solid progress on our transformation plan during the quarter. Our primary focus this fiscal year has been on the top-line and we are particularly pleased with our momentum on this front as underlying sales trends, notably consumption continue to strengthen across our domestic retail segments. The investments we are making behind our brands to drive enhanced saliency, distribution and consumer trial are having the intended impact. These investments were largely above the line this quarter and consistent with our strategy to partner with retailers to acquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands and new innovation.The timing of these increased investments converged with greater than expected inflation in the quarter including higher transportation costs, as well as higher than expected reductions in retail customer inventories. Combined, these factors created near-term pressure on our gross margin despite the fact that we continue to price ahead of our categories. Our M&A activity continued this quarter. We were very disappointed in the Federal Trade Commission’s decision on the proposed Wesson sale and we are continuing to review Wesson’s role in the portfolio. But, we kept our M&A momentum nonetheless.Our solid performance has enabled us to raise our full year adjusted EPS guidance range. As a reminder, the guidance we most recently provided at CAGNY already accounted for the impact of the tax law changes. Today’s incremental increase is based on our underlying performance. Even without the aid of Tax Reform, we would still exceed the high-end of our original guidance range driven by a strong top-line. As you can imagine, this is very satisfying, particularly in a far more onerous inflationary environment than we planned for. At our inaugural Investor Day in the Fall of 2016, we committed to do three things; increase margins, improve top-line, and build a winning company. Strategically, our biggest priority this year has been strengthening top-line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate. After three quarters, we like what we see. Our focus on bending the trend on the top-line continues to gain traction. We expect to continue experiencing some variation in our results quarter-to-quarter, but over time, we also expect to grow. As you will recall from last quarter, our shipments exceeded consumption largely behind the hurricanes. Of our 230 basis point improvement in top-line growth in Q2, we estimated that approximately 220 basis points were related to the hurricanes. During our Q2 call, we shared that we expected a reversal of this dynamic in Q3 with consumption outpacing shipments, particularly in our higher margin Grocery and Snacks segment. That expectation played out. So taking a step back, combining Q2 and Q3 performance enables us to create a more normalized cohort that takes out the timing effect of the hurricanes and highlights the steady progress we are making to drive consumer takeaway. As you can see on Slide 9, we expect our strong top-line trends to continue in the fourth quarter. Our deliberate efforts to cut unprofitable SKUs and pullback on low-quality promotions are now largely behind us. In our largest segments, we’ve done a significant amount of the heavy value over volume lifting and the results are clear. As our new innovations have hit the marketplace, our top-line has responded with consistent, steady improvement. So while it remains early days, we are happy with our growth momentum and we are excited about the future. Our categories continue to grow largely driven by our efforts. And you can see that we are growing share. ",
                 'CXO': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Megan Hays. Ma'am, you may begin.Megan P. Hays - Concho Resources, Inc.Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Concho's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Our earnings release and corporate presentation are available on our website, and we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q today after market close.Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statement and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP metrics are in our earnings release and corporate presentation.I'm joined this morning in Midland by Tim Leach, Chairman and CEO; Jack Harper, President and CFO; Will Giraud, Executive Vice President; and members of the Concho senior management team. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions.Now, let me turn the call over to Tim.Timothy A. Leach - Concho Resources, Inc.Thanks, Megan. Good morning. Well, the Permian continues to be as busy as ever, November oil production is forecasted to be 3.5 million barrels a day, up 26% year-over-year, and accounting for 60% of the total U.S. production growth this year. Costs have started to stabilize as the industry awaits new long haul pipe capacity before increasing activity.The basin continues to have the largest U.S. rig count at 490 rigs, but rig additions have slowed. At the same time, the drilled but uncompleted backlog has reached new highs and will likely be a catalyst for activity once the new pipeline projects are completed.The Midland discount to Cushing's WTI has narrowed as capacity may come online sooner than previously expected. The futures curve indicates that Midland barrels will be priced at a premium WTI in 2020 and beyond. The dynamic backdrop reinforces the advantage of scale, running a big stable program and being headquartered in the middle of the action.Third quarter was another strong quarter for Concho. Results include partial quarter contribution from the RSP acquisition. As a result, we won't go through the normal comparisons against prior periods as they won't be especially meaningful.This was a busy quarter. We made investments of approximately $760 million in our high-return inventory and once again fully funded our drilling program within cash flow. Production for the quarter was 287,000 Boes per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Additionally, the RSP transaction was completed in July and the teams are now fully integrated.We started transitioning the development of these assets to large-scale manufacturing mode in line with the rest of our portfolio. We've previously discussed the significant advantages created by the efficiencies and growth we can achieve through these large-scale projects. Jack will provide more color on this shortly, but the shift in our capital program for next year demonstrates our focus on bringing more large-scale development across our portfolio, including the RSP acreage.Over the past several years, we've effectively managed our business to best position Concho for future cycles, fuel long-term growth and consistently expand returns to shareholders. This focus has included growing oil production within cash flow, optimizing the development of our resource, reducing our cost structure, and strengthening our asset base with acquisitions, divestitures and trades.All of this has led to a compelling outlook for free cash flow generation and strong oil growth. There's growth for the sake of growth and then there's value-driven growth. We believe we've delivered value-driven growth over the past decade. Over that period, our business model was to estimate our cash flow and determine our investment level with production growth as an output.In recent quarters, we've guided you to the evolution of this model. We said that a new model was on horizon for Concho and our industry. RSP accelerates it. We're well-positioned to deliver on a model that provides competitive oil growth, a dividend to our shareholders and free cash flow.And with the free cash flow, we'll have the flexibility to make additional returns to shareholders, reinforce our balance sheet and play offense. Consistent with this framework, we plan to proceed with disciplined growth of our capital program, easing into larger programs to optimize the reinvestment rate on our assets and maximize corporate returns, all while generating significant free cash flow.",
                 'COP': "I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP, Investor Relations and Communications. You may begin.Ellen R. DeSanctis - ConocoPhillipsThanks, Christine. Hello, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer; Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects; and Matt Fox, our EVP of Strategy Exploration and Technology.Our agenda for today's call is to have Ryan review our key milestones from the third quarter, from the year-to-date, and then some of our focus areas for the remainder of the year.I want to note that all of our usual financial and operational highlight slides are included in today's deck in backup for your information. They're very straightforward. So after Ryan's remarks, our plan today is to go directly to Q&A. Our cautionary statement is shown on page 2 of today's deck. We will make some forward-looking statements during the call that refer to future estimates or plans.Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide and in our periodic filings with the SEC. And then, finally, we'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today, and that's to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers. Reconciliations to those non-GAAP measures to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website.And now, I'll turn the call over to Ryan.Ryan M. Lance - ConocoPhillipsThanks, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. 2018 has been another exceptional year for ConocoPhillips. Slide 4 summarizes our achievements from the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.Our value proposition is all about returns. We're laser-focused on disciplined free cash flow generation and strong execution. Discipline means we're not chasing higher prices by ramping up activity. By staying disciplined, we generate strong free cash flow, which we then allocate in a shareholder-friendly way. And underpinning our discipline in cash flow allocation is predictable, consistent execution quarter in and quarter out.Our commitment to these elements has driven strong results across the business in the third quarter and throughout this year. Starting with our strategic milestones on the left. Earlier this month, we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. In July, we increased our 2018 buyback target to $3 billion. That's the pace we're on for the year. At the same time, our board increased the total authorization to $15 billion, representing about 20% of our shares since the buyback program began.This sent a strong signal to the market that we have confidence in our plans for continued shareholder value creation. The combination of our dividend and buybacks represents a return to shareholders of about 35% of CFO, well in excess of our 20% to 30% target. Importantly and distinctively, these distributions were funded organically.We're delivering on all our strategic priorities and that means focusing on all aspects of value capture. For example, there's been a lot of interest in our ICC proceedings with PDVSA. We announced in August that we had reached a settlement agreement to fully recover the arbitration award of about $2 billion. This was a major milestone in this effort. This quarter, we recognized $345 million of that settlement. So we are collecting.Finally, we continue to optimize our portfolio and have announced about $600 million of additional dispositions over the past few months. Our financial performance has improved consistently throughout the year. Stronger prices help, but we're also benefiting on a relative basis due to our Brent weighted mix and from ongoing efforts to mitigate inflation risks and keep a lid on costs.In the third quarter, we generated $1.6 billion, or $1.36 per share of adjusted earnings. And here's some interesting perspective. The last time ConocoPhillips generated quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion from continuing operations was in the third quarter of 2014. Brent was over $100 per barrel and our production was almost 1.5 million barrels of equivalent oil per day. So we're as profitable today as we were then despite prices being 25% lower and volumes being 20% lower. So bigger isn't always better. That's why we're focused on per share growth and value, not absolute volume growth.Our portfolio and efficiency efforts have boosted the underlying strength of our company and driven what we believe is peer-leading sustaining price of less than $40 WTI. We've significantly improved our resilience to low prices without capping upside for investors and that's the key to outperformance through the cycles.Cash from operations in the third quarter was $3.5 billion and CapEx was $1.6 billion. So we generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow, which more than funded our dividend and buybacks.",
                 'STZ': "Patty Yahn-UrlaubThank you, Lori. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters I’d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.Robert SandsThank you, Patty, and good morning, and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. As I reflect on 2017, I am reminded that it has been a dynamic time for our business. We posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation stock increasing almost 50% for the calendar year 2017 versus the S&P 500, which grew about 20% for the year. Overall, stars, Constellation was one of the best performers among the S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks.I believe our excellent stock price performance continues to be driven by our strong financial results and the ongoing growth prospects for our business. The confidence in our future business prospects compelled us to seek board authorization for a new multiyear $3 billion share repurchase program subsequent to the recent repurchases of more than 200 million of our outstanding shares. I'm also excited about our recent investment in Canopy Growth Corporation, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. Founded in 2014 and based in Ontario, Canopy Growth is one of the earliest commercial players in Canada's legal cannabis market and has a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and currently has a market cap in the $5 billion range.This investment provides Constellation with a first-mover advantage for a potentially significant emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. Our plan is to jointly collaborate with Canopy in a number of areas. Initially, we will be learning the cannabis business and the related consumer space and route-to-market while building and developing a successful cannabis beverage business.Now recreational cannabis is scheduled to become legal in Canada this coming summer with recreational edibles including beverages expected to become legal in the summer of 2019. We have no current plans to sell cannabis products in the U.S. or any other market, and we will not consider doing so until it is legal at all levels of government.Our initial investment of approximately $190 million represents an ownership interest of 9.9% of Canopy Growth plus warrants which give Constellation the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the future. In a few moments, David will review how we are accounting for this investment.And speaking of growth prospects, we posted another great quarter for our beer business, which generated 80% of the total U.S. beer category growth and claimed four of the top 10 share-gainer positions with Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Modelo Chelada, Tamarindo Picante and Pacifico. Overall, Constellation's beer business remains the leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market and was the clear winner for the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays, with excellent execution that drove share gains led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands continue to drive the growth of the portfolio with ongoing distribution and velocity gains. Throughout the quarter, Corona Extra maintained strong media support and became the official imported beer of four NFL teams while also featuring Jon Gruden in football promotions during the season.Corona Extra also increased relevance with Hispanic consumers through its partnerships with Latin music superstars Enrique Iglesias and Maná. The Modelo Especial fighting spirit campaign continued throughout our third quarter including national TV and promotional activities during the NFL schedule. In addition, national Spanish-language TV support ran through November including a strong presence with live soccer program and top-rated Spanish language TV networks. Social media on Facebook and Instagram also supported NFL, the Mexican Independence Day and the Dia de los Muertos for this brand. Collectively, these initiatives drove depletion growth of almost 17% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for our third quarter.",
                 'COO': 'I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kim Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Administration. Ma’am, you may begin.Kim DuncanGood afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies’ third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. During today’s call, we will discuss the results included in the earnings release along with the updated guidance and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Should you have any additional questions following the call, please call our investor line at 925-460-3663 or e-mail ir@cooperco.com.And now I’ll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.Albert WhiteGreat. Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I’m happy to say our strategic investments are paying off through accelerated revenue growth and strong momentum.As we continue driving success by capitalizing on current market conditions and our strong product portfolio, we have accelerated investment activity around several initiatives, including advertising and promotions associated with key accounts at CooperVision and PARAGARD and CooperSurgical. We’re confident this investment strategy will result in continued strong revenue growth.Regarding our third quarter consolidated financial results, we reported revenue of $660 million, up 19% year-over-year, which is an all-time high for the company. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3, up 14% year-over-year. Overall strength in revenues, gross margins and a lower tax rate were offset by planned spending and incremental currency headwinds, including FX being $0.10 worse than we had forecast for the quarter.Looking at our two businesses, CooperVision posted record quarterly revenue of $489 million, up 12% or up 9% pro forma. We saw a noticeable uptick in our daily silicone hydrogel lenses with pro forma growth of 43%, driven by MyDay and clariti posting solid growth worldwide. CooperSurgical posted record revenues of $171 million, up 44% or up 6% pro forma, led by stronger than expected growth of 9% from PARAGARD.Moving to the detail. CooperVision posted solid revenue growth in all three regions with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 6%, and Asia-Pac up 4%, all pro forma 14%. The Americas strength was driven by a very strong quarter for clariti and MyDay. In particular, the launch of MyDay Toric is going extremely well and we’re seeing a halo effect on the sphere, where MyDay sphere posted really strong results.EMEA posted solid results against a very challenging comp with growth in the region driven by our full suite of silicone hydrogel products, including our dailies and our Biofinity and Avaira suite of products. Success was especially evident within our key accounts, where we have been heavily focused and gaining traction.Asia-Pac continued posting very strong results, driven by our silicone hydrogel dailies and Biofinity. This is a fantastic growth region for us and our investment strategies around key accounts, sales force expansion and geographic expansion continue yielding a lot of success.So overall, Q3 was a very strong quarter for a number of reasons and we expect the strength to continue based on our momentum. On products, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% pro forma.Regarding Biofinity, we were slightly capacity constrained again this quarter, but have already added capacity and will be adding even more in the coming months. This capacity expansion will help the entire Biofinity franchise, but especially Biofinity Energys, where demand has exceeded supply, as this new product has been more successful than expected.Regarding Avaira, total sales declined slightly, but the Vitality upgrade is now finished outside of a few small markets, where we’re awaiting final regulatory approval. A nice takeaway is that, we had growth outside the Americas, where we’ve generally been able to focus on selling rather than transitioning the product, and that’s a good sign for future results.Turning to product categories, we remain a global leader in Torics and Multifocals and grew 9% and 10%, respectively pro forma. Growth was driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, including MyDay Toric, which is being received extremely well in numerous markets; and clariti multifocal, which posted strong growth.Turning to the broader $8.3 billion soft contact lens market, we’re continuing to see strong growth led by the shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses, broader product offerings and geographic expansion. Daily lens has continued to drive the majority of the growth now accounting for roughly $4.3 billion, or 51% of the overall market. And within dailies, it’s no surprise that silicone hydrogel lenses are driving the majority of that growth.',
                 'CPRT': 'Jeff LiawThank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I will start with the Safe Harbor in a moment. I am joined today by Executive Vice President, Will Franklin, who will also provide additional commentary on the business.First, the Safe Harbor, during today’s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related fees, certain income tax benefits, foreign income tax credit limitations and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We have provided the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart’s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above.In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the management’s discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that maybe made from time-to-time on our behalf.Now, I will transition to a review of Copart’s third quarter. We are pleased to report all-time highs for Copart’s in unit sales, revenue, gross profits and operating income. We experienced global revenue growth of 27.9%, including a beneficial year-over-year currency effect of $8.6 million primarily due to relative strength in the British pound. Excluding Hurricane Harvey which had a modest effect on the quarter, we experienced revenue growth of 27%. Global unit sales grew at 12% versus the third quarter of last year with U.S. unit growth of 12.7% and international unit growth of 8.5%. Our growth in the U.S. has been driven by market growth, customer wins and acquisitions. Inventory worldwide grew at 8% year-over-year, less than 1% of the inventory at the end of the quarter, were catastrophic vehicles related to weather events and approximately 1% of the inventory growth is attributable to acquisitions, which we will comment on later in the call.Service revenue grew $78.4 million versus last year or 23.6% and purchase car revenue grew $25.9 million or 62.4% in that case due to acquisitions and growth in certain European markets. Our gross profit grew from $172.5 million a year ago to $219.1 million this year with a slight decrease in gross margins from 46.1% to 45.8% driven by a slightly higher vehicle sales mix and importantly Hurricane Harvey expenditures of $7.4 million for the quarter.I will pause here to talk about average selling prices, which as you know are a driver of our business. We experienced improvement in ASPs year-over-year of approximately 17% in the U.S., 16% ex-catastrophic cars. Continuing the themes you have heard us talk about on the last few calls, the underlying drivers of the sales price improvements have included are auction performance and member recruitment, but additionally also newer cars being totaled, less severely damaged cars, more bidding activity, a reasonably healthy used car price environment, and a solid scrap environment as well. Will will additionally comment on this matter further in our call. I noted a moment ago that our gross margin was affected by excess catastrophic expenses of $7.4 million in the quarter. After taking into account revenue from those same catastrophic events, Hurricane Harvey represented a net effect of $3.9 million operating loss for the quarter and a $12.8 million loss through the first 9 months of fiscal 2018.Turning our attention to general and administrative expenses, they were up from $32.5 million a year ago to $39.1 million this year ex-depreciation and amortization with almost half of the increase due to acquisitions. As we have noted consistently, our general and administrative expenditures will grow over time with inflation and with increasing complexity in the business. We continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the top line growth rates we have experienced.Our GAAP operating income grew from $136.8 million a year ago to $174.6 million this year or 27.7% change. Excluding that catastrophic loss of $3.9 million I noted a moment ago, our operating income growth would have been 30.5%. We have shown slight operating margin expansion despite the modest shift towards vehicle sales revenue. Our net interest expense for the quarter was down from $5.5 million a year ago to $4.1 million this year due largely to a lower debt balance offset slightly by higher interest rates – higher risk-free interest rates.',
                 'GLW': 'Welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter Three 2018 Earnings Call.It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Division Vice President of Investor Relations.Ann NicholsonI’d like to remind you that today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the Company’s financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.

Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website to download.Now, I’ll turn the call over to Wendell.Wendell WeeksThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent sales and earnings growth for the third quarter, and we’re increasing our full-year 2018 outlook.In total, for the quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 16% year-over-year; net income was $476 million, up 18 year-over-year; and EPS was $0.51, up 28% year-over-year. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42%, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018. All businesses delivered year-over-year sales and NPAT growth.Highlights include Optical sales up 22% year-over-year; Environmental sales up 19% year-over-year; Specialty Materials sales up 23% year-over-year, better than expected, driven by strong pull for new innovations such as Gorilla Glass 6. In Display, as expected sales and net income grew year-over-year, and annual price decline continue to improve, reaching the important milestone of mid single digits.As we said we would, we grew sales and profitability significantly by leveraging our recent phase of intense operating and capital investments to capture substantial benefits. Third quarter results demonstrate a step change in our earnings power. Underpinning our success are climbing production and efficiency rates at several of the largest expansion projects, plus strong customer adoption of our innovations.Our annualized sales run rate now exceeds $12 billion. Growth is accelerating and our margins are expanding. Execution across the Company is outstanding. We expect to exceed $11.3 billion in full-year sales, up more than 10% year-over-year. And we expect to build on this strength as we address the rich set of opportunities ahead of us. So, we feel great about both the back half of 2018 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in just a few moments.Now, let’s turn to the strategy and capital allocation framework, which outlines our leadership priorities. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019; we plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and to $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress toward the framework goals we announced in October of 2015. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of the third quarter, we have returned $11.4 billion to shareholders.Dividends per share have increased 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our four-year plan, totaling $7.3 billion through September 30th.As outlined in our framework, Corning is best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. Capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing.We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation and creates stronger competitive advantages, and delights our customers.Now, turn to our progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications.Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. First, I want to note the team’s response to the September hurricane in North Carolina, home to most of our fiber and cable manufacturing. Our people pulled together and did an outstanding job, working through the challenges of Hurricane Florence. They showed the highest level of commitment to safety and to supporting each other. Despite this powerful storm, their efforts kept us on track with our expectation for high-teen sales growth this year.',
                 'COST': "Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. You may begin your conference.Richard GalantiThank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start of course by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.In today's press release, we reported our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks that ended on May 13th. Net income for the quarter was $750 million or $1.70 per share that compared to $700 million or $1.59 per share last year in the third quarter. Last year in the third quarter, net income was positively impacted by the $82 million or plus $0.19 per share tax benefit and that was in connection with the $7 per share special cash dividend that we had done at that time.I’ll start by reviewing our third quarter operating results and then allow some time of course for Q&A. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $31.62 billion, or 12.1% increase over last year’s third quarter sales of $28.22 billion. Net sales for the first 36-weeks of fiscal 2018 increased 12.0% to 95.02 billion, up from $84.82 billion last year to date – last year for the first three quarters year-to-date.In terms of comparable sales, which are reported in the press release, for the 12-week period U.S. was 9.7, excluding the impact of gas inflation it was 7.7. Canada on a reported basis for the 12 weeks comps were 11.3, and ex-gas inflation and FX impact was up 4.8. Other international reported at 11.8, ex-gas inflation and FX 5.8. So, all told, total company at 10.2% comp and ex-gas inflation and FX up 7.0%.E-commerce, which we, of course separate out here is 36.8% for the 12-weeks, and 35.5% ex-FX. So that continues strong. Similar statistics in the press release for the 36-weeks year-to-date. In terms of third-quarter sales metrics, third-quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 5.1% both worldwide and within the U.S., strengthening foreign currencies relative to U.S. dollar impacted sales by approximately 145 basis points to the positive, and gasoline inflation added an additional 170 basis points.Cannibalization weighed on the comp to the tune of minus 60 basis points. Our average front-end transaction or front-end ticket was up 4.9%, and again excluding the benefits from both gas inflation and FX that average ticket would have been up somewhere in the mid-high single digits about 1.7%, 1.8%, up. Next on the income statement and membership fee income, reported in the quarter $737 million, up $93 million from $644 million during Q3 of last year or up 14.4%.The benefit of strong foreign currencies was about 9 million of that $93 million increase or ex that it would have been $84 million. Now, of the $93 million increase year-over-year, a little over half related to the membership fee increases that we have taken in the last year, year-and-a-half. The majority of which came from the $5 and $10 annual fee increases taken last June 1 in the U.S. and Canada. And a small balance of that from the fee increases taken other international operations starting back in September of 2016.We will continue by the way to see membership fees based on the deferred accounting, the June 1, 2017 increases in U.S. and Canada last year. We continue to see the benefit of that year-over-year increase in the membership fee line. It will peak in Q4, this coming quarter, this 16-week quarter and then still year-over-year increases, but all are – at least three may be four of them, all of next year in fiscal 2019 as well. In terms of membership fee renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada member renewal rates at Q3 end came in at – were 90.1%, similar to where they stood a quarter earlier at 90.1. Slight uptick just rounding to the 90.1.Worldwide rates improved to 87.5%, up from 87.3% 12 weeks ago at Q2 end, with the uptick in renewal rates and other international operations led by Asia, both Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, in terms of total number of households at the end of Q2 it stood at 50.4 million and 12 weeks later at the end of Q3 is now – it then stood at 50.9 million. Total cardholders, 92.2 million a quarter ago, 12 weeks ago, and at Q3-end 93.0 million.During the fiscal quarter, we had two new openings. Also, at Q3-end, as of Q3-end our paid executive member base stood at 19.0 million households. That’s an increase of 199,000 households from 12 weeks earlier or about 17,000 new Gold Star members per week. Related to the benefit from last year's fee increases that year-over-year quarterly fee increase volumes I mentioned continue to benefit both Q4 and into several quarters next year, but on a diminished amount year-over-year quarter.Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 46 basis points, coming in at 11.05% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 11.51%. Now that minus 46 basis point figure year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding gas inflation it was minus – it would have been minus 28 and let me again ask you as I usually do to jot down just a couple of columns for Q3 2018. The first one would be, as reported, and the second one would be excluding the impact of gas inflation. The five-line items, the first one would be merchandise core.",
                 'COTY': "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Monaco. Mr. Monaco, you may begin your conference.Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer and Patrice de Talhouët, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All commentary on organic net revenues reflect the comparison of combined net revenues at constant currency in both the current and prior-year periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business.In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.I will now turn the call over to Camillo.Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings call. Our results were generally in line with our expectations, as we deliver steady performance with modest positive organic top line growth, supported by strong growth in a number of brands, emerging markets and new channels, partially offset by some challenges, mainly in Consumer Beauty. Q3 represent another very strong quarter for our Luxury division, while our Professional Beauty division once again demonstrating consistent solid sales growth.The Consumer Beauty division continues its uneven performance but with encouraging China stability and some bright spots that I will discuss in a moment. The continued stabilization trend of our top line coupled with ongoing improvement in our cost structure resulted in another quarter of healthy adjusted operating profit improvement.I'm pleased with this progress and with the improvements we've made so far. However, as I've said before, there is still much work to be done, before we realize the consistent results that we seek, as we deliver our synergies and continue the integration of the P&G Beauty Business.Moving on to our divisional performance, our Luxury division delivered outstanding 6.1% organic new revenue growth, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of healthy sales gain. Our strategy, which focused on increasing premiumization, including a strong innovation pipeline and superior store execution, propelled growth across all regions and most brands.We continued to gain share in travel retail farther building upon our leadership position in the fragrance category. Here I would call out our performance in Asia, where we saw strong consumption trends for our key innovation such as Gucci, Bloom and Tiffany, but also new levels in China, Korea, and Thailand. Our European travel retail business also experienced excellent momentum in the quarter.The continued strong growth in Luxury in EMEA was driven by both innovation as well as channel expansion in key geographies. China, for example, grew strong double-digits driven by the recent rollout of Tiffany in the country. The continued success with philosophy as well as recent changes made to our go-to-market strategy for Gucci. In fact, Tiffany's launch in China was so successful that it propelled the brand to a top two position at Sephora in China.As for innovation during the quarter, we capitalized on the continued success of Gucci, which enjoys a strong top 10 position in most key markets by launching Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori and Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme with both showing very positive results.Finally, in March we launched Chloé Nomade which has been showing promising results in its first weeks in the market. Looking ahead to future growth, we have recently launched a new Burberry fragrance and we recently announce a new launch for our Marc Jacobs Daisy franchise for the first time in over four years called Daisy Love with an ad campaign featuring Kaia Gerber.Moving on to our Professional Beauty division, organic net revenues increased 1.9%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Our strategy to be the best part into salon owners and professionals led to growth in all key hair brands and OPI. This solid performance was driven by the continued strength of Wella Professionals, which continues to benefit from the success of our Wellaplex product line, but also from other brands like Nioxin and Sebastian, which are performing well in most channels.I'm also pleased that OPI continued to grow globally with particular strength in our North America region, which has shown growth – which have grown for the past four quarters. In fact, both (05:45) had a solid growth in the quarters, still benefiting from the restage of our gel product line, which includes new color coordinated bottles.",
                 'CCI': "Good day and welcome to the Crown Castle Q3 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ben Lowe. Sir, you may begin.Ben LoweToday the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle.com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning.This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected. Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors section of the Company's SEC filings.Our statements are made as of today, October 18, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Supplemental Information Package in the Investors section of the Company's website at crowncastle.com.So with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.Jay BrownThanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. Over the last two decades, we have established an unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and 65,000 route miles of high capacity fiber in the top U.S. markets where we see the greatest long-term growth.We continue to believe the U.S. represents the best market in the world to earn shared communication infrastructure, and we believe our ability to offer a combination of towers, small cells, and fiber solutions to our customers provides a valuable differentiation in the market.On this call, I wanted to highlight two important things. First, our strategy to invest in towers and small cells and fiber has positioned us to capture accelerating leasing activity which is driving dividend growth. And secondly, we continue to see tremendous opportunities to invest in new assets that we believe will generate future growth.On the first point, executing on our strategy is leading to consistent dividend growth. As we increased our annualized common stock dividend by 7% to $4.50 per share, in line with what we believe our AFFO per share growth will be in 2019.The growth in 2019 is based in part on our pipeline of contract with new business which has increased in each quarter this year and is driving the accelerating new leasing growth we expect to see in 2019. As shown in our outlook, we expect the positive trends to continue as we expect towers to contribute approximately $125 million to new leasing growth in 2019, which is up nearly 15% from the $110 million we expect to see in 2018.Likewise, we expect small cells to generate new leasing activity of approximately $75 million in 2019, which is more than 35% higher than the $55 million we expect in 2018. In addition to the expected acceleration and new leasing activity, our pipeline of contracted small cell nodes to be constructed over the next 18 to 24 months continues to grow, and currently stands at an all-time high of approximately 35,000, which is up 40% from this time last year.This increased activity is a result of all four of our large customers investing in their networks through towers and small cells to both keep pace with the current 4G demand environment and position their networks for 5G. Carriers in the U.S. are expected to lead the way and be among the first operators in the world to deploy commercial 5G services with all for the national carriers working to rollout 5G services currently.Underscoring how attractive the U.S. market is for communications infrastructure ownership, Ericsson estimates that 5G will account for nearly 50% of mobile subscriptions in North America by 2023, compared to just 20% globally. According to industry estimates, mobile data traffic in North America will increased by 40% per year between now and 2023, resulting in a staggering eight fold increase in the volume of data writing across mobile network.This growth and data will require substantial densification of wireless networks. And we believe Crown Castle is in a great position at the center of these megatrends as our portfolio of well located towers and dense high capacity metro fiber assets remain the most cost effective option for our customers deployment needs.In the near-term since 2014 and inclusive of the dividend increased we announced yesterday, we have grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8%, fueled by these underlying industries trends and the resulting revenue growth.Turning to the second thing, we’re excited about the significant investments we are making to build new assets that we expect will drive long-term growth in cash flows and dividend per share. We believe we are in the very early innings of a huge opportunity with high capacity dense metro fiber, which has become critical for wireless and wired networks.Over the last several years, we have built and acquired an unmatched portfolio of more than 65,000 route mile of high capacity fiber in the top market where we see the greatest long-term demand from multiple customers. Consistent with our expectations, we continue to see very attractive initial returns on our fiber investments with initial yields of 6% to 7% for the first tenants.Over the long-term and similar to towers, we expect the returns on these investments to increase as we add more customers to our fiber assets, which will drive future dividend growth. We are using the same playbook we used with towers by sharing the asset across multiple tenants to generate attractive returns and it’s playing out better than we expected.Looking back five years ago, we had an aspirational goal to be able to deploy about $10,000 nodes per year. At the time, we were adding 1,000 nodes per year, so this was seen as a significant increase and capability. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect to deploy between 10,000 and 15,000 nodes exceeding our aspirational goal. Our team has done a terrific job building capability and expertise that can deliver for our customers at significant scale.Further proving out the model, we are seeing demand from multiple tenants on the same fiber asset with a meaningful portion of the nodes we expect to deploy in 2019 collocating on existing small cell networks. By collocating additional tenants on existing fiber networks we are able to generate high incremental margins that we expect will grow the yield into the mid to high-teens over time.",
                 'CSX': "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]For opening remarks and introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Boone, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.Kevin BooneWith that, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.Jim FooteGreat. Thank you so much, Kevin, and thank you everyone who is on the call.We are very excited about the strong performance of the railroad. Incredible things can be done by incredible people. The CSX workforce is proving every day that they are not going to back a backseat to anyone when it comes to running a safe, customer focused, and efficient railroad.I want to give a special shout out to the operating team that positioned our effort out of harm’s way in advance of the recent hurricanes. And to Ricky Johnson and all the engineering folks that did an amazing job in getting us back up and running with minimal delay in the aftermath of both storms.Before moving to third quarter results, I’d like to comment on a few initiatives we worked on in the third quarter. First, we made changes to the organizational structure on our operating apartment, which pushed more real time, decision-making to the field. Our management team has embraced the change and I am encouraged by the early positive results and momentum it has delivered.Second, we announced new major initiatives at our Northwest Ohio Intermodal terminal. This facility functions has a sorting facility under the previous hub and spoke strategy. We will now leverage this app tech and its important strategic location as a traditional Intermodal terminal to drive new revenue opportunities.As part of our plan, we are working with NorthPoint Development to establish a logistics park adjacent to the terminal. This logistic center will require no capital from CSX. We also announced the new haulage agreement with BNSF. That enhances western access to the facility. And we are working on expanding access from these coast ports. I believe these initiatives will drive long-term growth opportunities to CSX.Now, let’s get to the results. I said it last quarter, and I’ll say it again today. Two words sum up everything, great performance. Nothing unusual, again, these numbers are straightforward. EPS increased 106% to $1.5 versus $0.51 last year. Operating income growth of nearly 50%, combined with the lower tax rate and 6% fewer outstanding shares contributed to the significant year-over-year increase.Our operating ratio improved 970 basis points to 58.7, a substantial improvement and a record third quarter for CSX. The operating results are highlighted by 14% complex growth including 4% volume growth, combined with lower expenses despite much higher fuel costs.Let's turn to Slide 6. Revenue increased 14% at volume, price, fuel surcharge and supplemental revenues all contributed to positive growth this quarter. Looking at the business segment, each was impacted by positive price and fuel recovery. Merchandise revenues grew 12% this quarter, helped somewhat by lapping some of the service issues last year. Nearly every end market saw a double digit increase with the exception of Fertilizers, which was impacted by a previously-disclosed customer shutdown.I am encouraged by the broad-based growth across this portfolio. Coal revenues increased 14%, with strength in our export business offsetting domestic utility weakness. We also saw good growth in our steel and industrial business. In Intermodal, we saw a growth from both price and volume. Finally in other revenues, similar to previous quarters, we saw an increase in supplemental fees including demurrage.On the next slide, Slide 7, let's take a look at our safety performance. The safety of our employees is my number one priority. As you can see on these charts, we made some good progress this quarter, and we need to sustain this momentum. The personal injury rate this quarter is encouraging but we must improve by training accident rates.As I had mentioned, we have an initiative way to drive further improvement. We have a strong turn-up by employee in our recent safety survey, which is a good sign of employees' involvement. I will continue to prioritize safety above everything else and expect us to make further progress.On the next slide, Slide 8, on the efficiency and service slide. Train velocity and dwell both saw improvement - significant improvement over last year. And they're also much better than last quarter, velocity improved 28% and dwell improved 26% both on a year-over-year basis.Cars online continues to trend lower, down almost 14% year-over-year despite volume increasing 4%. This really shows the improved asset utilization we are achieving. And you can see our trip plan compliance. This is a very important measure as it reflects not only the railroad's operating performance but most importantly, how we are performing from a reliability standpoint for our customers. We have seen an improvement of 26% from the first quarter to the third quarter this year. And we just started measuring this in 2018. While we have made good progress, there is plenty of room to improve.Now, let me hand it off to Frank who will take you through the financials and operating improvements in greater detail.",
                 'CMI': "I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Smith, Vice President of Finance. Sir, please go ahead.Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2018.Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger, our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward, and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, will all be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast are available on our website, at cummins.com, under the heading of Investors and Media (1:50).Now I'll turn it over to Tom.Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.We delivered strong quarterly sales and record profits in the third quarter. Revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the third quarter of 2017, with growth in all of our operating segments and most major geographic markets. EBITDA was a record $983 million, or 16.5% of sales compared to $788 million or 14.9% of sales a year ago.Engine business revenues increased 17% compared to a year ago, due to strong demand in on-highway markets in North America and growth in construction both in China and North America. EBITDA for the quarter was 14.9% of sales compared to 11.8% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased with the impact of higher material costs more than offset by the benefit of higher volumes, improved pricing and lower warranties.Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 10% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for new engines and for parts and service in off-highway markets. Third quarter EBITDA was 8% of sales compared to 6.8% in the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA percent and dollars have improved throughout 2018 because of targeted price increases and cost control measures.Third quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 14%. Sales in North America increased 25% and revenues in international markets grew 2%. Increased truck build rates in North America along with sales from the automated transmission business drove domestic growth. International sales increased through strengthened European truck markets offset lower demand in China. The automated transmission business contributed 5% to segment growth.EBITDA for the third quarter in the Components segment was a record $288 million or 16.4% of sales compared to 16.9% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin declined due to the dilutive effect of the automated transition business, which reached its one-year anniversary in the third quarter.The share of heavy-duty trucks in North America with an automated transmission has risen steadily over the last year, with adoption rates now at 73% in new trucks. Fuel economy benefits and improvement in drivability have lead to the strong adoption of the technology and even Cummins is a market share leader in North America.Power Systems sales in the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year, with higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas customers, partially offset by a reduction in marine revenues. EBITDA in the third quarter was 14.7% of sales compared to 10.5% a year ago, driven by the positive impact of higher sales and the benefits of previous restructuring actions.In our electrified powertrain business, third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $30 million. There's a strong customer interest in our technology and we are actively developing products for urban and shorter-range applications where we expect the quickest adoption of this technology.Now I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2018, starting with North America, and then I will cover some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 17% in the third quarter due to growth in demand in most end markets and ramp-up of the automated transmission business.",
                 'CVS': "ntationMichael P. McGuire - CVS Health Corp.In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information in our prepared remarks as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Our Form 10-Q will be filed at the end of the day today and that too will be available on our website. After prepared remarks, we'll be opening the call up for Q&A. In order to provide more people with the chance to ask their questions, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up.During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views related to our future financial performance, future events and industry and market conditions as well as the expected consumer benefits, financial projections and synergies from the soon to be completed acquisition of Aetna. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what maybe indicated in the forward-looking statements.We strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these specific risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the cautionary statement disclosures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should also review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release.Additionally, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance during this call. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and the comparable GAAP measures in the associated reconciliation document to be posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's call is being webcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.Now, I'll turn this over to our President and CEO, Larry Merlo.Larry J. Merlo - CVS Health Corp.Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased with the solid performance of our business in the third quarter, and strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cash flow year-to-date demonstrate our success in driving value. And I would note that Aetna reported its quarterly results on October 30, which were also strong. And the performance of both companies highlights the very solid financial foundation on which we will build our revolutionary new model, which will transform the health care experience for consumers and, in the process, deliver substantial value for our shareholders.Now as most of you know, we received Department of Justice approval of the transaction on October 10 and we're now in the final stages of the state approval process. Of the 28 states, we have approvals in 23 including Connecticut, our lead regulator, and we're well down the line with the remaining five and expect to close prior to Thanksgiving. In the meantime, our integration work continues to make great progress and our teams are working extremely well together to assure that once final approvals are obtained, we can immediately begin to execute our integration plans. Both CVS and Aetna are passionate about revolutionizing the consumer health care experience and while we have been clear that the cost savings are substantial, this transaction is about the significant value creation that will be realized as a result of growth.We'll be able to share more of the specifics after our two teams come together to begin the real groundbreaking work, but we thought it would be helpful to get a bit more granular by highlighting the work streams we have underway. And our integration and innovation teams' immediate priorities in preparation for close fall into two broad categories: first, is successfully delivering on our stated goal for year-two synergies; and a second is executing on the foundational pieces of our new health care model to achieve longer-term growth and value creation.Today, we have a clear line of sight into year-two synergies that now exceed our original $750 million goal by just combining our existing assets and capabilities. The majority of these synergies will be derived from the reduction of corporate expenses and the integration of our operations, along with some reductions in medical costs. We plan to accomplish the latter through actions that increase adherence to prescription regimens and close gaps in care, along with programs that optimize the site of care either to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits or move expensive therapies such as infusion to lower cost sites of care.",

Our pre-tax profit margin for the nine-month period improved 140 basis points to 12.6%.

For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 19.1%, an improvement of 280 basis points from a year ago. For the nine months ended June, we generated $534 million of cash from operations excluding Forestar.

The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 13% from the prior year to $4.4 billion and homes sold increased 12% to 14,650 homes. Our third quarter sales growth was driven by a 15% increase in community sales pace offset by a 3% decrease in our average number of active selling communities.Our average community count was flat sequentially from the second quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $298,000 and the 21% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the same quarter last year. The value of our backlog increased 7% from a year ago to $5 billion with an average sales price per home of $301,000 and homes in backlog increased 9% to 16,536 homes. Jessica?",

Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the continuing operations of the company in the third quarter of 2018 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.We may also describe certain products and devices which are applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in concerned markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. And actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Tom.Tom JoyceThanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We have built terrific momentum throughout 2018 and this continues in the third quarter with our team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6.5% core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth. Our expanding top-line performance was broad-based and we’re particularly pleased with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. Through the first nine months of this year, we delivered 6% core growth, a result achieved through a combination of new product innovation, strong commercial execution and strategic acquisitions which has increased our exposure to attractive end markets. Our team’s performance utilizing the Danaher business system is enabling us to innovate more effectively and to get better products and solutions to our customers sooner, all of which we believe is contributing to sustainable market share gains. So turning to our third quarter results, sales increased 7% to $4.9 billion with the impact of currency translation, decreasing revenue by 1.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6.5% with four of the five platforms delivering mid single-digit or better core growth. Third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.10, representing 10% growth year-on-year. We generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in a free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of 123%. Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up double-digits with China and India leading the way. In developed markets, mid single-digit growth was led by momentum in North America and Western Europe. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 55.4%, while core operating profit margin expanded 50 basis points. During the quarter, both gross and operating margins were negatively impacted by volatile currently movements, particularly in a number of the high growth market countries. Year-to-date, our gross margin is up 60 basis points and we’ve increased our core operating margin by 100 basis points led by our Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Environment & Applied Solutions segments. So now let’s take a more detailed look at our third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 14.5% and core revenue was up 9.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 19.6% with 230 basis points of core margin improvement. This is the platform’s ninth consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement. So, turning to the individual operating companies, Beckman Life Sciences delivered high single-digit core revenue growth with positive results across most major product lines and geographies. The team’s strong commercial performance and recent new product launches focused on higher growth biologics and genomics markets are helping Beckman increase their customer win rate and we believe they continue to gain share relative to the market.',
                 'DRI': ' I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin.Kevin KalicakGood morning everyone and thank you for participating on today’s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden’s CEO, and Rick Cardenas, CFO.As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company’s press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.darden.com. Today’s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings on June 21st before the market opens, followed by a conference call.This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide an update on our financial results and outlook for the year. During today’s call and for the remainder of this fiscal year, all references to Darden’s same-restaurant sales will only include Darden’s legacy brands since Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants are new to Darden.Now, I’ll turn the call over to Gene.Gene LeeThanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you see from our press release this morning, we had another good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.13 billion, an increase of 13.3%. Same-restaurant sales grew 2%, despite the negative weather impact, which Rick will address in his remarks. And adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.71, an increase of 29.5% from last year.I am proud the ways our teams have executed against our strategy we rolled out three years ago, our operating teams remain focused on foods, service and atmosphere and at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on our four competitive advantages. Leveraging our significant scale to create cost advantages, using extensive data and insights to improve operating fundamentals and to better understand our guests and communicate with them more effectively, ensuring our brands systematically go through our rigorous strategic planning process, and cultivating our results-oriented people culture to enable growth.Olive Garden had another solid quarter. In fact, December was the highest total sales month in the history of the brand. Overall, same-restaurant sales grew 2.2%, the 14th consecutive quarter of growth, outperforming the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 310 basis points. Same-restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmarks excluding Darden by 440 basis points.During the quarter, Dan Kiernan was appointed President of Olive Garden. I am excited to have an outstanding operator like Dan leading the team. His passion for our team members and guests coupled with his deep understanding of the brand makes him the perfect leader for Olive Garden.Olive Garden continues to consistently deliver strong results, which I attribute to the brand’s strategic focus on driving frequency among our most royal guests. This begins with flawless execution of the guest experience, and we will continue to focus on simplification to improve execution of our standards.We were also able to drive more frequency by introducing craveable menu items that create excitement among our core guests. We introduced the new appetizer loaded pasta chips, and a new lunch entrée, the Meatball Pizza Bowl, during the quarter and both were supported with successful integrated marketing campaigns that drove overwhelming PR buzz.Additionally, our focus on off-premise sales is doing more than just meeting our guest needs for convenience. It’s also enabling us to capture dining experiences that guests would not have previously considered for us. During the quarter, off-premise sales grew 13% and were approximately 15% of total sales for the quarter. Building loyalty also means that we need to continue to deliver meaningful value to our guests, every day.During the quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to build awareness for everyday value, highlighting our Lunch Duo starting at $6.99, Early Dinner Duos starting at $8.99 and [indiscernible] pasta starting at $9.99. The work we are doing is resonating, as industry data shows that Olive Garden has seen the largest improvement in our value ratings versus key competitors over the last year.Our focus on everyday value and simplification has also allowed us to reduce the number of promotional offers we’ll run this year. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we will not offer our one of our most popular promotions, Buy One Take One that we ran during the fourth quarter last year. Buy One Take One is a strong promotional platform for us. And to assure its long-term effectiveness, we don’t not want to risk over exposure. However, not running this promotion may have a short-term impact on our traffic in Q4. I am encouraged by Olive Garden’s momentum and we’ll remain focused on making decisions that ensure our guests win.',
                 'DVA': "Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.Thank you, Iris, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me in the room today are: Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. And also joining us via teleconference are Kent Thiry, our CEO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our third quarter release of earlier today and our SEC filings. Please refer to our third quarter earnings release of earlier today or in SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in DaVita.I've got four headlines before we let JR and Joel take over.Headline number one of course is the Prop 8 victory, but I'm going to let Javier talk about that primarily, certainly excellent news for all of our stakeholders. Number two, regarding the sale of DMG, we continue to work together with Optum to close the transaction in 2018. However, as most of you will recall, we did execute an amendment earlier this year to extend the termination date in case we do not meet that timeline in light of the ongoing regulatory approval process. Number three of four, the quarter did have some unusual expenses, which Joel and JR will go through in some depth. So they do not get in the way of your ability to evaluate the ongoing strength of the business. And finally, fourth headline is, as you net it all out, it's a solid operating quarter in what has been so far a solid operating year.And then, finally before we go into all the different detail and synthesis, we are first and foremost a clinical caregiving company. That is what comes first and so consistent with our tradition, we'll always talk about a clinical accomplishment at the top of the call.We're going to broaden that slightly going forward to include either a clinical accomplishment or an improved patient experience. And what I'm going to talk about right now is more in the latter category because so far this year-to-date, we've added on a net basis 1,300 more PD patients, peritoneal dialysis that is, people that can take care of the dialysis without coming into our centers.Now this does not always lead to improved clinical outcomes, in many cases those clinical outcomes will stay the same, but for many of these patients, it's a tremendous improvement in their quality of life, because of the scheduling and physical mobility that they pick up and so that's our patient experience story of the day.Javier, please take it over.Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Let me jump right in. I will discuss four topics today, Prop 8, calcimimetics, team and an update on guidance for 2018.First on Prop 8. Let me start with the obvious. We are pleased that Prop 8 was defeated. This was the right outcome for our patients, California and the entire system. We thank not only the California voters but also the entire coalition of over 160 members that worked hard to defeat this union-backed ballot initiative. The broad coalition included the California Medical Association, the California Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association of California, the American College of Emergency Room Physicians and California Chamber of Commerce to mention a few.In pursuing Proposition 8, we believe that the SEIU-UHW abuse of ballot initiative process and displays disregard for patients by putting the union's organizing objectives above access to life-sustaining care. Unfortunately, we do not anticipate them stopping their efforts. We expect this to cause us to spend considerable resource opposing these types of initiatives over the next years. While it's difficult to forecast we're assuming an increase in our baseline spend of $30 million per year on general advocacies plus whatever incremental spend is necessary to counter the specific initiative.",
                 'DE': 'Josh JepsenHello. Also on the call today are Raj Kalathur, our Chief Financial Officer; John May, President of Agricultural Solutions and Chief Information Officer; Ryan Campbell, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Brent Norwood, Manager, Investor Communications.Today, we will take a closer look at Deere’s third quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlooks for fiscal 2018. After that, we will respond to your questions. Please note slides are available to complement this call. They can be accessed on our website at www.johndeere.com/earnings.First, a reminder, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Participants in the call, including the Q&A session, agree that their likeness and remarks in all media maybe stored and used as part of the earnings call. This call includes forward-looking comments concerning the company’s plans and projections for the future that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in the company’s most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.This call may also include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, GAAP. Additional information concerning these measures including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at www.johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings & Events. Brent?Brent NorwoodJohn Deere had another solid quarter with contributions from both our equipment operations and financial services group. The higher reported earnings were a result of favorable market conditions and a positive response to our innovative and advanced product lineup. In agricultural markets, replacement demand continues to drive sales activity for large equipment, while construction equipment sales benefited from increased investment in oil and gas, housing and global transportation.Now, let’s take a closer look at our third quarter results beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenue were up 32% to $10.3 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $910 million or $2.78 per diluted share. The results for the quarter included a favorable net adjustment to provisional income taxes of $62 million. Excluding this item, adjusted net income was $849 million. On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were up 36% to $9.286 billion. Currency translation was negative by 1 point. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. The impact of Wirtgen was 17 points.Turning to a review of our individual businesses, starting with agriculture and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 18% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison primarily driven by higher shipment volumes, price realization and lower warranty expenses. Operating profit was $806 million, up 16% from the same quarter last year or 35% when excluding the impact from the sale of SiteOne. Operating margins for the quarter were 12.8%. Before we review the industry sales outlook, let’s look at the fundamentals affecting the ag business.On Slide 6, corn stocks-to-use ratio is expected to decline in response to increasing global demand and drought conditions experienced during the first crop in Argentina, which lowered the country’s corn production by roughly 25%. Conversely, soybean stocks-to-use ratio is forecast to build in response to higher than expected yields in the U.S. Wheat stocks-to-use ratio is projected to decline in 2018 in response to intensifying drought conditions in Europe, Australia and the Black Sea region. As a result, U.S. farmers are seeing increasing export demand for the year.Slide 7 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. 2018 farm cash receipts are estimated to be about $375 billion, roughly flat with 2017. Crop cash receipts are projected to be on par with last year as favorable commodity prices in corn and wheat are partially offset by softness in the soybean market. Receipts from livestock are also flat due to strong domestic and export demand balanced by growing supply and lower prices. Our ag economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. While crops began to season in fair conditions, more recent results across the EU have varied due to regional droughts. Nonetheless, the overall crop value of production is still expected to increase in 2018. Overall, arable farm profitability remains slightly below long-term averages. Those severe regional droughts are negatively impacting Central and Northeast Europe, while the Southern and Western regions report more positive conditions. Furthermore, favorable wheat prices are also contributing margins in key markets. Profitability for the dairy segment remains above long-term averages though production and input costs will likely be impacted by recent drought conditions.',
                 'DAL': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jill GreerThanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. The entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session.Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.Edward BastianWell, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier, we reported a $1.6 billion pretax profit in the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.80, which was at the high-end of our initial guidance. Our EPS was up 16% over last year driven by strong revenue momentum, tax reform benefits, and a 4% lower share count.Demand for the Delta product has never been greater. Our revenues grew 8% to nearly $12 billion, a record level for the Company and now we expect to achieve 8% topline growth for the full-year. We have seen continued success in addressing fuel cost increases and offset roughly 85% of the $655 million impact of fuel cost for the quarter. Our speed in recovering these costs has never been better and gives us confidence that we can fully recapture fuel costs at these levels as we head into 2019 and start to grow our margins once more.I'd like to thank the Delta people for running the best airline operation and continuing to raise the bar. We've now had 100 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, both Delta Mainline and Delta Connection, already exceeding 2017's full-year record of 90 days. I'd also like to thank the team for the incredible job they've done with the difficult and challenging conditions of Hurricane Michael. We've had less than 100 cancellations over the last two days with minimal financial impact. We are the last operator out of the Gulf Coast stations and we’re the first carrier to return to these stations today.Our customers depend on Delta and we put our customers' needs and interests first. That's the Delta difference. This unprecedented level of reliability combined with great service from our team that is driving our customer satisfaction scores to new heights.Our domestic net promoter score has averaged 44% this year, which is up three points over the prior year. This is the reason why our revenue per premium is at record levels and sustainable. In recognition of our employees' outstanding performance, we've added another $395 million toward next February's profit sharing payout. This is in addition to awarding a 3% base increase, which was effective October 1, for ground employees and flight attendants.Later this month, we'll celebrate the 10th anniversary of our merger with Northwest, which was the beginning of the campaign to become the very best airline in the world for our employees, owners, and the customers and communities that we serve. In those 10 years, we've led an unprecedented transformation at Delta and our industry. We are financially stronger and able to withstand industry cycles like never before.We have increased our global reach to 52 countries with an innovative strategy that includes over $2 billion in equity ownership of our airline partners. Through our commercial efforts, we have taken Delta from mid-teens NPS and a revenue deficit to the industry to a carrier with leading customer satisfaction and a sustainable revenue premium.And through it all, we've shared that success with our people and at the same time, achieved an investment-grade rating and returned nearly $12 billion to our owners through dividends and share repurchases. Despite three significant upward moves in fuel this year, driving more than $2 billion of higher fuel expense, we still expect to deliver our fourth consecutive year of pretax profits over $5 billion.",
                 'XRAY': "I will now like to introduce your host for today's conference, John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.John P. Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.Thank you, Ashley. And good morning and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. I'll remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at dentsplysirona.com.Our earnings call presentation and many of the numbers discussed on the call today will be non-GAAP financial measures and there are reconciliations provided in our press release and in our earnings deck. The earnings call will be a little longer than usual today, as Don and Nick would like the opportunity to tell you about the diagnostic they've completed on the business and details of the upcoming restructuring plan.But before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results and we base those statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.John P. Sweeney - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. We have a lot to cover, and appreciate you taking time with us this evening. Before talking about the specific results, I wanted to offer some perspective. After spending nine months here, a few things are very apparent. The first is that the dental industry is a great place to be with positive underlying trends relating to demographics, technology and economics.Further, I believe, that Dentsply Sirona is well-positioned to succeed with a strong global footprint, important brands that have a loyal following, a strong track record of innovation tracing back over 100 years and, most importantly, a dedicated, passionate workforce.But it's equally clear that our current business performance and trajectory over the past three years is not where it needs to be. We are not living up to our potential to deliver for our customers, investors and our employees. Our results in this quarter further highlight the need to take decisive action to better position the company for long-term value creation.As part of the call today, we will outline the results of an extensive diagnostic and offer a major restructuring plan that we've begun executing against. Key components of that plan will focus on how we deliver sustainable 3% to 4% revenue growth and an operating margin of 20% by 2020, with further improvements targeted through 2022.We plan to simplify the organization and have developed an aggressive cost-cutting savings target of over $200 million today. Just as we are disappointed in and fully accountable for our results, as we go through the presentation today, you will see that we are optimistic about the future of the business and that we are committed to taking the necessary steps to deliver attractive financial performance going forward.Let's begin with the summary review of the third quarter. As you can see on slide 7, our top line was down 6.5% on internal basis in the third quarter. The revenue decline was significantly impacted by planned changes in our dealer inventory stocking levels in our Technologies & Equipment segment; and a $20 million reduction in Consumable revenues, resulting from a startup challenge in the new central distribution hub in Europe.Our lower top line and increased expenses drove an adjusted operating income margin of 13% and adjusted EPS of $0.38. Operating cash flow was $126 million in the third quarter, reflecting the strong underlying cash flow generating capabilities of Dentsply Sirona.Before I go into more detail on our restructuring plan, I will now turn the call over to Nick Alexos, who will go into more details on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year.Nick William Alexos - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.Thank you, Don. And for everybody's reference, we're on page 9 of the slides, the segment performance for Consumables. As you know, we report across two segments: Consumables and Technologies & Equipment. Our Consumables segment accounted for 47% of our revenue for the third quarter and represents a diverse portfolio of products that provide steady growth at stable margins.However, in Q3, as Don mentioned, our Consumables segment had an internal revenue decline of 3%, as we had a $20 million revenue shortfall resulting from operational issues at our European distribution center in Venlo, the Netherlands. Venlo is our centralized European distribution site.As a result of the move to Venlo during the last year, in Q3, we experienced startup shipping delays for some of our product lines. We've put systems and a team in place now to fix these particular issues, and have seen improvement back to levels required for hitting our fourth quarter shipment forecast. While this was unfortunate, the facility will provide us with the infrastructure to more efficiently serve our customers in the European market.Excluding the Venlo impact, Consumables revenues actually achieved low-single digit growth. The lower shipment volumes for Venlo, however, which caused also an unfavorable mix shift on our product sales, were the principal driver of our Consumables segment margin decline by 370 basis points as compared to the 2017 third quarter.If you now go to page 10, segment performance for Technologies & Equipment. This segment accounted for 53% of the revenue for the third quarter. As you all know, our T&E segment has a number of unique technologies and includes our implant and healthcare businesses.",
                 'DVN': "I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Scott Coody - Devon Energy Corp.Thank you, and good morning. I hope everyone had the chance to review our financial and operational disclosures that were released last night. This data package includes our earnings release, forward-looking guidance and detailed operations report. Additionally, for the call today, we have slides to supplement our prepared remarks. These slides are available on our website and we will make sure to refer to the slide number during our prepared remarks so that everyone can follow along.On today's call I will cover a few preliminary items and then I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager. Dave will provide his thoughts on the strategic directions of Devon. Following Dave, Tony Vaughn, our Chief Operating Officer, will cover a few highlights from our U.S. resource plays and provide his perspective on the current market dynamics in Canada. And then we will wrap up our prepared remarks with Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer, covering our financial highlights. Overall this commentary should last around 15 minutes before we head to Q&A.I would like to remind you that comments and answers to the questions on this call today will contain plans, forecasts, expectation and estimates that are forward-looking statements (01:26-01:28). These comments and answers are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially. For a review of risk factors, please see our Form 10-K.And with that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Hager.David A. Hager - Devon Energy Corp.Thank you, and good morning, everyone. For today's call my comments will touch on three key messages related to the strategic direction of Devon. Turning to slide 2, the first key message I want to emphasize is our commitment to our disciplined, multiyear development plans. At Devon, we fundamentally believe that a steadier and more measured investment program through all cycles is the correct strategy to optimize corporate level returns, grow our business, generate free cash flow and reward our shareholders with increasing amounts of cash returns. With this disciplined approach to the business, the benefits of any pricing windfall above our base plan will simply manifest in higher levels of free cash flow for Devon, not higher capital activity. I am absolutely convinced this balanced operating model is the future of the E&P business and we will be a leader in this movement.Importantly, this bold commentary is backstopped by actions which has resulted in several value enhancement accomplishments year to date. Our light oil growth is running ahead of plan with no modifications to our capital spending. This combination is a unique success in the E&P space this year. We have taken action to materially improve our corporate cost structure, delivering $475 million of savings on an annualized basis.Our capital discipline has resulted in free cash flow in the second half of 2018 and, coupled with divest proceeds, we have generated nearly $4 billion of excess cash inflows this year. We have strategically deployed a portion of this excess cash flow to reduce debt and we have raised our net debt to EBITDA target of 1 to 1.5 times nearly two years ahead of plan. And maybe the most important highlight of 2018 is the industry-leading amounts of cash we are returning to shareholders through our $4 billion share repurchase program.All in all, we are executing at a very high level on the objectives underpinning our strategy and I expect our disciplined business model to continue to deliver differentiating results in the future. Looking ahead to 2019, my second key message is that we are accelerating investment in our world-class Delaware Basin assets.Turning to slide 3, from a total company perspective, we directionally expect our E&P capital to range from $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion in 2019. With this activity, the Delaware will be our top funded asset by a wide margin with investment increasing by greater than 25% to nearly $1 billion. As showcased in our Q3 operations report, the increased activity in the Delaware is an easy capital allocation decision given the massive step change improvement in well productivity and returns we have experienced over the past year. Importantly, we have secured the supply chain, infrastructure and takeaway capacity to execute on our development plans.Beyond the Delaware, the STACK and Rockies will also be important growth assets for us in 2019. With our refined approach to infill spacing, we expect the STACK to be our second highest funded asset in 2019 and the doubling of activity in the Rockies will also contribute to our oil growth initiatives. Specifically in the STACK, we are very confident we have determined the optimum well spacing of 4 to 8 wells per drilling spacing unit. This quarter marks an inflection point in both returns and volumes for the STACK. Better days are on the way very soon in the STACK.",

Diamondback was able to execute on multiple, long-term strategic initiative over the last three months, all while maintaining our focus on near-term execution with best-in-class operating efficiencies and margins.We grew production 9% quarter-over-quarter to a 123,000 BOEs a day while decreasing cash cost over the same time period. Our production is now up 45% year-over-year all from organic growth within cash flow, and our updated 2018 production guidance implies 50% year-over-year growth within cash flow.In a world where capital discipline is now the primary theme across North American energy and companies are discussing what they plan to do, look no further than what Diamondback has done over the past three years. Our operating philosophy has not changed. Maximized production growth within cash flow, maintain best-in-class operating metrics, low leverage, and execute on acquisitions accretive to our current acreage position and per share metrics. All of which, we continue to do in the third quarter.During the third quarter, we announced our transformational combination with Energen. As an update, we have received regulatory approval for the merger, and the shareholder meetings are scheduled for November 27 with the deal expected to close shortly thereafter pending shareholder approval. We are currently operating 14 rigs and Energen is currently operating 10 rigs, both split evenly between the Midland and Delaware Basins.We see this rig count as the baseline for our 2019 operating plan as we integrate the merger and work to instill best practices across the pro forma company's asset base. We will begin delivering on the primarily synergies presented in our merger presentation immediately, and our 2019 capital and production guidance will reflect this pro forma cost structure, which we will look to present in the coming months after the merger closes.We were also able to close multiple significant acquisitions in the Northern Midland Basin including the previously-announced Ajax acquisition and the recently-announced ExL acquisition. These acquisitions add 25,000 Tier 1 acres to our existing inventory and have three zones with greater than 100% IRRs at current commodity prices.The blocky complementary nature of these assets gives us significant running room for capital efficient, long-lateral development. Also because there are minimal drilling obligations across the block, we can run multiple rigs drilling large, multi-well pads and efficiently develop the reservoir.Diamondback will continue to look for assets complementary to our existing asset base that compete for capital right away within our existing portfolio at acquisition prices that allow us to generate full-cycle returns well in excess of our cost to capital. With the size and scale of our pro forma business, we will look to continue to grow production differentially within cash flow, add inventory and acreage without compromising our balance sheet, and grow a return of capital program through our dividend.With these comments now complete, I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss our operational highlights for the quarter.Michael L. Hollis - Diamondback Energy, Inc.Thank you, Travis. In the third quarter, Diamondback continue to execute on both our near term and long-term crude marketing strategies. In the near term, we have over 100,000 barrels per day in gross production, lock-in firm transportation agreements with multiple third parties. These deals have been signed over the last six months and have various fixed differentials to Gulf Coast pricing, including deals linked to Brent and MEH.",
                 'DLR': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, is also on the call and will be available for Q&A.The management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. First, we followed up our record bookings in the prior quarter with our second highest and our backlog reached another high watermark. Next, we announced our entry into Latin America. Third, we beat consensus by a $0.01 and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet extending our weighted average debt maturity by a full year with the issuance of $520 million of 12-year paper at 3.75% and the refinancing of our $3.3 billion credit facilities.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had a very productive third quarter with consistent execution against our strategic plan.Let's turn to page 2 of our presentation. The highlight of the quarter was the announcement of our entry into Latin America with a definitive agreement to acquire Ascenty for $1.8 billion. Ascenty is the leading data center platform in a rapidly growing market. It's best-in-class management team and proprietary fiber network have made it the partner of choice for the leading global cloud providers, and as a result, it has the largest market share. Ascenty's portfolio is comprised of eight in-service, purpose-built, world-class data centers and another six data centers currently under construction, totaling 106 megawatts of planned capacity. The in-service portfolio was approximately 97% leased as of September 30. While the data centers under construction were approximately 83% pre-leased. Since our announcement, the Ascenty management team has continued to execute generating additional fiber revenue and leasing another 3.6 megawatts in October to two leading global cloud providers, bringing their year-to-date leasing tally to approximately 30 megawatts.Given its high quality portfolio, Ascenty serves a blue chip customer base of 140 logos, including the leading global hyperscale cloud providers.In fact, investment grade or equivalent clients account for over 90% of revenue. In addition more than 75% of Ascenty's contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars substantially mitigating foreign currency exposure. I might add here that the real has appreciated by 10% since we announced the acquisition just over a month ago. This transaction immediately establishes Digital Realty as a leading data center provider in Latin America. Ascenty enjoys approximately 30% market share in Brazil far outstripping its competitors.We believe we can further accelerate the company's success, capture additional market share and expand our total addressable market by leveraging digital realties global platform. In fact we've received a number of inbound calls from existing customers inquiring about data center capacity in Brazil since our announcement in late September. The transaction also presents significant growth potential in a key emerging market.Brazil has the eighth largest economy in the world and it's the fifth most populous country, but less than 60% of the population currently has internet access. As this relatively young market continues to come online and as consumers, local enterprise customers and global IT service providers begin to expand their presence in Latin America, we see significant opportunities to ride this next wave of growth. Finally we've structured the transaction to benefit from two sets of partners with local market expertise and a strong track record of execution.We are pleased to be partnering with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager with a well-established track record of investments in Brazil, across infrastructure, renewable power, real estate and private equity. Brookfield has committed to initially invest $613 million in exchange for a 49% equity interest in a joint venture expected to ultimately own Ascenty. Brookfield has been investing in Brazil for over 100 years, and is now one of the largest investors in the country with over $40 billion of assets under management. The partnership with Brookfield provides unparalleled access, experience and resources within the market to help us grow and rollout our strategy.In addition Ascenty's management team led by CEO, Chris Torto is staying with the company. Management is rolling forward the substantial majority of its equity into Digital Realty OP units subject to a three year lockup as well as a 2% stake in the joint venture with Brookfield. This transaction is prudently financed. We raised common equity to fund our equity contribution the same day that we announced the acquisition, consistent with our historical practice, in addition to the equity contributions from Brookfield and the Ascenty management. We've also lined up non-recourse debt financing. Partly due to the conservative capital structure, the transaction is expected to be approximately 2% dilutive in 2019, and 1% dilutive in 2020.",
                 'DFS': "Craig Streem - Discover Financial ServicesThank you, Celisia. Welcome, everyone, to this afternoon's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and Second Quarter 10-Q, which are on our website and also on file with the SEC.In the Third Quarter 2018 materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles our non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And, of course, we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. As we announced on August 3, effective October 1, Roger Hochschild succeeded David Nelms as Chief Executive Officer of Discover. David and Roger worked together in leading Discover for 20 years, with Roger serving as President and Chief Operating Officer since 2004. Roger's been very active with the investment community in the past, so he should be well-known to many of you. And the transition in leadership should be as seamless to all of you as it's been to our 16,000 colleagues at Discover.Our call today will include remarks from Roger, covering third quarter highlights and developments. Then, Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And as Celisia said, after Mark completes his comments, there'll be time for questions and answers. But I would ask during the Q&A session, if you would please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial ServicesThanks, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm tremendously honored to succeed David as CEO. This transition comes with Discover in a great position, generating solid growth and robust returns, and with the Discover brand stronger than ever. Discover represents a unique combination of assets built on a culture that places the highest value on serving our customers, whether by introducing unique features in our card business or innovations in payments.I'm proud to have been part of the team for 20 years and excited to have the opportunity to build upon that legacy as we pursue our aspiration to be consumers' most trusted financial partner. Even with a change at the top, our priorities remain the same. First, the Discover lens-centric business model, integrated with the benefits of our proprietary network, remains at the core. We will continue to invest in the brand, in a differentiated customer experience, and in advanced analytics. And, of course, we'll maintain our consistent conservative approach to credit risk management. This strategy has served us well and continues to produce outstanding results.With that let's turn to slide 3, and review those results for the Third Quarter. We earned $720 million after tax, or $2.05 per share this quarter, generating a return on equity of 26%. This performance reflects the strength of the Discover business model, as well as consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Looking at the fundamentals, total loans grew by 8% in the quarter, led by 9% growth in the card business. This was above industry average, as the Discover brand continues to resonate with our target customers. New accounts were up 14% year-to-date, and we're also seeing higher engagement with both the number of active card members and spending per card member growing nicely. Our private student loan business shows the strength of the Discover brand beyond the card business, setting us up for another year of record originations. Student Loan Originations during the peak season were up 12%, as a result of improved brand awareness and greater effectiveness in our marketing efforts.In Personal Loans, it's clear the competitive intensity has not lessened, supported by the significant level of capital that has entered the market over the last few years. Much of this competition is from unbranded players, which means that their principal means of differentiation and growth is on price or credit standards. As we said, we will not chase growth that does not meet our return objectives, hence our decision to cut back on origination activity, and we continue to expect personal loan receivables at year-end to be flat to down from the prior year end.Focusing now on Credit. Overall performance is encouraging. In our card portfolio, the seasoning of recent years' vintages, along with continued normalization in the back book are in line with our expectations. In addition, we continue to invest in enhancements, not only in our underwriting processes, but also our servicing platform. We are increasingly leveraging data, advanced analytics, and machine learning to enhance the quality and efficiency of our servicing activities whether in day-to-day customer service or how we collect past-due accounts. This is paying off for us in a variety of ways. It creates a better customer experience, it improves the scalability of servicing operations, and it leads to better credit performance.",
                 'DISCK': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Andrew Slabin, Vice President (sic) [Executive Vice President] (0:25) of Global Investor Strategy. You may begin.Andrew T. Slabin - Discovery, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer.You should have received our earnings release, but, if not, feel free to access it on our website at ir.corporate.Discovery.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar and then we will open up the call for your questions. Please try to keep to one question, so we can accommodate as many as possible.Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.And with that, I will turn the call over to David.David M. Zaslav - Discovery, Inc.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Our business is strong and we feel just great about what we have accomplished since we closed the Scripps merger. And we're proud of the results we have delivered this quarter. We really like our hand and our strategy.Discovery is a true global IP company, with real differentiation from the rest of the industry, and powerful operating momentum around the world. We remain optimistic about the road ahead, as we drive forward with our plan to transform our global business.It was eight months ago that we closed on Scripps, and it has exceeded our expectations on every front. We are delivering strong cost synergies, enhancing our global suite of content and IP and accelerating the process of broadening and refining our product offerings. In doing so, we continue to maximize value from the linear ecosystem, while continuing to attack opportunities to drive our IP across the global direct-to-consumer landscape.Discovery is making strong headway on all these strategic areas, much of which is reflected in our operating results this quarter, which Gunnar will review in more detail shortly.Let me highlight a few operating metrics, where we are very proud of the company's achievement and progress this quarter. First, our strong 5% domestic advertising growth, marked by accelerating performance at both the legacy Discovery and Scripps Networks on the back of improved ratings, healthy overall pricing, nice growth on our TV Everywhere apps and strong execution by the sales and network teams.Secondly, our heightened focus on improving operating efficiency, fueled by our transformation efforts, drove impressive total company margin improvement of 500 basis points to 40%. This contributed to substantial free cash flow generation at over $900 million this quarter and facilitated us reducing our net debt by just about $1 billion this quarter and helped us reduce our net leverage significantly faster than originally projected at close.Additionally, I'd like to focus this morning on a few key areas in which we are establishing differentiated growth performance relative to our peers and where we are gaining further traction from our strategic pivot. At Discovery's domestic networks, we are outperforming the marketplace and are currently bucking some of the trends we are seeing across the industry. Our ratings momentum has been an outlier in an industry where both cable and broadcast performance has been increasingly soft.For the third quarter, ratings and delivery across our core networks were up 1% in L3, (4:55) well outperforming both the cable and broadcast markets. Discovery is the number two TV company in America, including both broadcast and cable, with NBCUniversal being the only company in the U.S. that reaches more people and is larger.Within the pay-TV universe, we deliver a near-20% share of viewership among all viewers and nearly a quarter share among women. That strong position in delivery provides a distinct advantage and an opportunity on the sales and marketing side to promote our content across a much larger audience base. This past quarter, we had three of the top five pay-TV channels for women in both prime time and total day and achieved a 23% share of the female audience.On any given night, we are getting between a 3 and a 4 rating in women 25 to 54 across the portfolio, and typically exceeding a 4 rating on Sunday night. And across the pay-TV universe alone, we are achieving between a 5.4 and a 7.2 rating in women 25 to 54 across the portfolio. Putting some context around this, premium IP in the U.S. today is incredibly scarce, with perhaps the NFL as the very top of the pyramid with respect to aggregating both male and female demos in large scale. And advertisers pay a significant premium for this IP.So, if you're an advertiser buying the NFL to reach women, you could reach the same number by buying one spot, a roadblock, across our top women's networks, HGTV, Food, TLC, ID and OWN. It's like a women's super-pack. And I believe we can intercept some of those huge CPM, NFL or broadcast dollars, which would be a big win for advertisers, because it would be at a much lower CPM, a big increase for us and a huge reach. And it's something that nobody else can do because we have this ability now to aggregate so many compelling and strong female networks. It's one of the wow reveals of Discovery and Scripps coming together.",
                 'DISH': "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the DISH Network Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.Before we get into Erik's prepared remarks, I think Tim has to do the Safe Harbor disclosures.Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.I do. Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. All right. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or the firms in your reports. We also do not allow audiotaping of this call and we ask that you respect that. Statements that we make during the call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and/or our forecasts. For more information please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear.You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating. As part of the process for FCC Auction 101 we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum assets. Because of the FCC's anti-collusion rules, we are not able to discuss what if any spectrum resources we may intend to bid on, and we will not be answering any questions about that auction during today's call.With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Erik Carlson.W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.Well, thank you, Tim. If you tuned into our earnings calls during Joe Clayton's years as CEO, you know he had his own special way of greeting participants, and as you may have read, we lost Joe last Saturday. Far too early. He was a giant in our industry, a passionate leader who left an indelible mark on our company, and so in honor of Joe, I'm going to open with, good afternoon to our East Coast participants, and good morning to those of you on the West Coast. Thanks for the memories, Joe.I've got a few remarks on our three primary lines. DISH TV, our legacy business, Sling TV and of course our Wireless business, our future business. So, let me start with Wireless first. As you may have seen the news in the last 24 hours, we've announced that Ericsson is serving as a key partner for us in our NB-IoT build-out. Ericsson's assignment is to deliver radio access and core network, and has delivered our national RF plan. Charlie and Tom are both here to take any questions you may have on that front.Turning to DISH, over the past several quarters I've had the opportunity to highlight recognition our company has earned for its excellent customer service. And once again, I can congratulate our team.Late in the third quarter, DISH earned J.D. Power's top award in our industry. Number 1 in overall customer satisfaction among national TV providers. The award really recognizes our focus on delivering a top quality customer experience as a premium TV brand. This is an ongoing theme at DISH and its disciplined effort to identify and address our weaknesses, while we continue to build upon our strengths.Service most certainly is one of those many strengths. So I'd like to congratulate everyone who has worked so hard for that honor, especially our front-line team. Now while we have enjoyed positive churn trends over the past several quarters, churn is a bit more complex this quarter.Our overall churn rate was 2.11% for the third quarter compared to 1.46% last quarter, and 1.83% in a year ago quarter. While service fundamentals remain in place, we can point to the Univision situation as having contributed to roughly half of the net sub loss in the quarter. Now loss attribution is not a perfect science, and lots of factors go into that data. But that will put you in the ballpark as you work to understand our trending.Also last week, AT&T pulled HBO from DISH for the first time in HBO's more than 40-year history. First let me apologize to our customers for that inconvenience. I want to be clear on what's behind this. It's not a disagreement over rate for an la carte premium service. This is about HBO requiring DISH to sign up for a guaranteed number of subscribers, and that's really regardless of whether another DISH customer ever chooses HBO. We don't think that's the right deal for our customers, it's definitely not the right deal for us, nor is it likely good for the industry, and we welcome any questions on that situation.",

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.Todd VasosThank you Jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, particularly given the two major hurricanes that devastated communities in some of our most heavily penetrated areas in the South Eastern United States. We stay focused on our initiatives, kept the customers at the center of everything we do, and our financial performance during the quarter demonstrated what this type of focus can produce.Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to express my gratitude to all of our teams who have worked so diligently in very difficult circumstances to serve the communities we call home. We recently visited with our field teams in the Carolinas and The Florida Panhandle where the damage was the greatest. I say it frequently, but it bears repeating, I am so inspired by our teams consistent dedication to our mission of serving others. Turning now to our third quarter performance, we delivered another solid quarter with strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. On the top line our same store sales growth of 2.8% resulted in our highest two year stack in 11 quarters. This quarter our comp growth was primarily driven by our customer checking out with larger basket. We believe this is a reflection of all the work we have done to make the box more relevant for our customers. As our customers needs evolve, they are telling us they want a fuller shop from us and we are delivering with even more of the products they want at the values they need. Year-to-date through the 2018 third quarter we posted 2.9% same-store sales growth, which continued to be driven by greater customer productivity. We feel good about our 39-week performance, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. We did, however, incur greater than anticipated disaster related expenses during the third quarter, primarily as a result of the hurricanes. We have updated our full year 2018 operating margin rate and diluted EPS guidance to include the estimated impact of these expenses on the third and fourth quarter results. John, will walk you through those details in just a moment. As we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, we remain focused on our operating priorities and we believe we are in a great position to finish the 2018 year on a strong note. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. Net sales increased 8.7% to $6.4 billion, compared to net sales of $5.9 billion in the third quarter 2017. We continue to be very pleased with both the productivity from our new stores, as well as the performance from our mature stores. Our 2.8% same store sales increase was again led by our strong performance in consumables. We are listening to our customers and providing the products they want and need. This performance allows us to continue growing market share. We remain well positioned against all classes of trade as evidenced by our market share gains in the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods ending November, 3, 2018 as measured by syndicated data. ",
                 'DLTR': "Randy GuilerThank you, Brandon. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the third fiscal quarter of 2018. Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, 8-K, 10-Q and Annual Report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up, if necessary.Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer.Gary PhilbinThank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. Today, we are going to discuss our third quarter performance as well as our plans to improve the consistency of execution across the Family Dollar store base and to optimize our real estate portfolio. This will include a meaningful acceleration of in store renovations and re-banners in 2019.This morning we announced results for the third quarter. Sales increased 4.2% to 5.54 billion. Consolidated same store sales increased 1%. By segment, comp sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.3%, the Family Dollar banner comps were down 40 bps compared to last year's Q3 increased of 1.5 on a two-year stack basis comps accelerated slightly. Our enterprise gross margin rate declined 110 basis points to 30.2. Operating income was 387.8 million or 7% and diluted earnings per share increased 16.8% to a $1.18 at the high-end of our guidance range.We delivered earnings within the range of our expectations despite continued cost pressures related to domestic freight and our investment in store wages. Dollar Tree delivered its 43rd consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth with increases in both customer transactions and average ticket. We are pleased with the performance of our newly renovated Family Dollar stores. Additionally, we have begun the important phase of consolidating our store support centers into our Chesapeake campus, which will improve our ability to support Family Dollar stores through enhanced collaboration, communication and teamwork.Dollar Tree continues to have a most unique, differentiated and defensible business model in U.S. value retail. Customers love our dollar fixed price point as demonstrated by 43 consecutive quarters of positive comps. Despite periodic cost challenges the Company has continued to deliver a relatively consistent gross margin annually with sector leading operating margin. Our 2.3 comp this quarter was on top of a 5.0 comp in last year's third quarter, and the comp growth was driven by balanced increases in both transaction count and average tickets.In our Dollar Tree banner for the third quarter, top performing categories were snacks and beverage, candy, stationary, greeting cards and our Halloween seasonal assortment. We are extremely pleased with the recent addition of the Hallmark brand to our product assortment at Dollar Tree, customers are thrilled with the values and the offering, and I'll touch more on that in a moment.Sales performance was driven by strength in discretionary categories. Comps were positive and exceeded 1.5% in all three months. October same-store sales were the strongest months in the quarter, and we saw a terrific sell-through on our Halloween seasonal merchandise. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the West, Southwest, Southeast, and all of our operating zones delivered positive comps.On last quarter's call, I briefly touch on our beginning of our new partnership with Hallmark. We introduce the new Hallmark greeting card program in June. Every Dollar Tree store in the fleet was re-fixtured and merchandised with a fantastic new assortment. The rollout across the chain was completed one week ahead of schedule and our customer acceptance and feedback has been terrific and was validated by a double-digit comp in our third quarter.We are able to enhance the assortment by market and store. We have cards tailored for African-American shoppers or Hispanic shoppers, religious, inspirational card occasions. We have fantastic every day and seasonal assortments with our Heartline brand and our best products of two for a dollar and our Expressions brand for a dollar per card, all are branded with the Signature Hallmark brand and recognizable crown logo. We are enthusiastic about this new partnership with Hallmark and it adds to our very important party category.Also during the quarter, we added new snack zones into an additional 300 stores. We now have snack zones up and running in more than 800 stores. Store and customer feedback has been terrific and our numbers support this as we like the lift not just from the category, but within the store.

                 'D': "Unidentified Company RepresentativeGood morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website to view the earnings press releases and accompanying materials as well as the slide presentation that will follow this morning's prepared remarks. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting, and the Investor Relations team will be available immediately after the call to answer additional questions.The earnings releases and other matters that will be disclosed - discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.Also on this call, we will discuss some of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings press release kit in the Dominion Energy Midstream Partners press release. For our prepared remarks, Jim Chapman, Chief Financial Officer will provide a financial update including quarterly earnings results, Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer will review safety and operating performance, highlight progress on growth initiatives and provide other updates. I will now turn the call over to Jim Chapman.James ChapmanGood morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including - includes lower operating and maintenance expense, higher-margins and our power generation group in better and normal weather.GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range.Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.369 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent complex committee to evaluate that offer.Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete the definitive agreement between the two companies this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distributions that was declared on October 19.Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy. Moving now to our credit and improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps for achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First in September, we closed on a $3 billion [indiscernible] term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing in terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent level debt. Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in three merchant powergenerating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across two transactions.We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure of these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sales proceeds are being used to reduce parent level debt. Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to first reserve and affiliated investment funds for total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment - earn out payment through 2021 based on Blue Racer midstreams ongoing performance. We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure.",
                 'DOV': "After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you.I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead, sir.Paul GoldbergThank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Dover's third quarter earnings call.Today's call will begin with comments from Rich and Brad on Dover's third quarter operating and financial performance and some comments on our 2018 outlook. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up.Dover is providing adjusted EPS results and EPS guidance that exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results, offers more transparency and facilitates easier comparability with peer companies.Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing and other costs are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials.Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website dovercorporation.com. This call will be available for playback through November 08 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. The replay telephone number is (800) 585-8367. When accessing the playback, you'll need to supply the following access code 1598024.And before we get started today, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today which are intended to supplement your understanding of Dover may contain certain forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to uncertainties. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement.We also undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rich.Rich TobinThank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on this morning's conference call, let's get started on Slide 3.Organic revenue was up 3% for the quarter as solid demand trends in Engineered Systems and Fluids more than offset the continued weak demand environment in Refrigeration and Food Equipment.Adjusted Q3 earnings of $203 million and adjusted earnings per share were up 9% and 14% respectively. Bookings remained solid at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and are broad-based across the portfolio excluding Refrigeration.Overall the quarter was largely in line with our internal forecast and our earnings comments at the end of Q2. We expected a slower Q3 relative to the previous quarter in Engineered Systems as a result of demand colonization and scheduled production shutdowns at our European operations, despite this Engineered Systems margin conversion, our volume remained strong at 47%.Fluids performed as expected with solid results in Pumps and Process Solutions buffering the residual footprint costs in fueling and transport. Refrigeration & Food Equipment proved to be tougher than expected in the quarter and we've incorporated current conditions into our full-year guidance.Our fourth quarter stacking up to be driven by improved margin conversion in our Fluids segment as we get our operational issues behind us, coupled with the flow-through of our cost initiatives more than offsetting the negative impact of Refrigeration and Food Equipment business and the higher tax rate projected for the quarter.We have significantly completed our SG&A rightsizing plans during the quarter, which we will address in the presentation and that we're moving forward with our footprint rationalization activities, which we expect to begin executing in Q4.As a result of the above, we have further tightened the top end of the range of our EPS guidance to $4.80 to $4.85 per share.I'll pass it to Brad here and come back during the segment slides, Brad?Brad CerepakThanks Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. As mentioned, our results were largely driven by solid demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially unchanged at $274 million and adjusted margin was 15.7%.This performance reflected strong conversion in engineered systems and improved performance in fluids, largely offset by lower volume in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $341 million.Adjusted earnings was $203 million and adjusted EPS was a $1.36. EPS benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate on discrete tax benefits. The full-year effective rate is now expected to be between 20% and 21%.",
                 'DWDP': "Good day and welcome to DowDuPont’s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, today’s call is being recorded.I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Sheorey. Please go ahead, sir.Neal SheoreySpeaking on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; Howard Ungerleider, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fitterling, Jim Collins, and Marc Doyle, Chief Operating Officers for DowDuPont’s Materials Science, Agriculture, and Specialty Products divisions, respectively; and Jennifer Driscoll and Lori Koch who will lead IR for Corteva and DuPont, respectively.Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K and each of Dow’s and DuPont’s Forms 10-K as well as Dow's and Corteva’s Forms 10 include detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences.Also, we will comment on segment results on a divisional basis, so please take note of the divisional disclaimer in our earnings release and slides. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis and all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website.I will now turn the call over to Ed.Edward BreenGood morning. Thank you, Neal and thanks to all who are joined for the DowDuPont third quarter earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter as you saw earlier today. I was pleased with the way our teams performed in all three divisions, as they successfully grew the top line and bottom line. They did this while delivering cost synergies, executing good price volume discipline, advancing their growth synergies and preparing for the spins.The financial highlights on slide two are as follows, first sales grew 10%. We saw continued demand for our products and executed well against our new product launches.While we had higher raw material costs and more currency pressure than we expected, we successfully increased pricing by 5 points while also delivering solid volume growth. The consistency across all divisions and regions was very good.Second, operating EBITDA increased 19%. We expanded our operating EBITDA margin with volume and price gains, cost synergies and strong executional role, and last, adjusted EPS rose 35%.As our divisions advanced towards separation, they continue to build out the structure and features necessary to their future success. Each of them continues to make progress towards their best-in-class cost structures. Cost synergies this quarter exceeded $450 million. We have executed against the majority of our cost synergy projects and those savings are coming through.Today we increased our cost synergy target to $3.6 billion another $300 million increase to reflect further expected benefits. These increased benefits are expected to begin to show in our results in the second half of 2019 and are primarily related to additional permit [ph] savings.For DowDuPont we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of low 20s percent growth. This is consistent with the increased guidance we provided during our second quarter earnings call. It speaks to our team's focus and our ability to continue to deliver a strong full year result, which comes from the levers within our control, execution of cost synergies, new product introductions, and growth investments to name a few.Another step towards separation was the naming of the boards of the three intended companies. These boards each consist of highly experienced, independent professionals across a range of relevant fields. They bring deep insights, expertise and support to their respective management teams as they work to drive growth and fully capitalize on the potential of our three independent companies.I really appreciate the good work the board and advisory committees have already done. They have worked closely with management to develop near-term strategic plans for the respective businesses.They also have worked hard to enable all three companies to be well positioned in their markets, great capital structures and plan to invest capital and R&D in a way that will drive meaningful shareholder value creation now and over the long-term.Our confidence in our future is one of the reasons we announced today a new share buyback plan, a $3 billion program. We intend to complete it before the first spin. This would bring our total expected share repurchases to $7 billion since merger close. We are - three financially strong independent companies each of which will be well-positioned for continued growth and further shareholder remuneration to be determined by each company's board at the time of spin.",
                 'DTE': "Barbara Tuckfield - DTE Energy Co.Thank you, Espie, and good morning, everyone. I would like to remind everyone to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings, provided in the appendix of today's presentation.With us this morning are Gerry Anderson, Chairman and CEO; Jerry Norcia, President and COO; Peter Oleksiak, Senior Vice President and CFO. We also have members of our management team with us for the Q&A session.And now, I'll turn it over to Gerry to start the call this morning.Gerard M. Anderson - DTE Energy Co.Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So before I dive into the presentation, I want to point out that EEI is right around the corner and it's at that conference that we're going to share the details of our long-term strategy and long-term growth plan. So, given that I'd ask that you hold your longer term strategy questions until we see you at EEI and can lay that out in detail.What we want to do this morning is provide a recap of our performance in the third quarter, update our guidance for 2018 and spend some time discussing our 2019 early outlook. I'll do that and then I'll hand it over to Peter, who will provide a financial review of the third quarter, some additional color around our increased earnings guidance for this year and segment detail for the early outlook for next year. And then finally Jerry Norcia will provide an investment and business development update at our utilities and our non-utility businesses. And then we'll wrap up by taking your questions.So moving on to slide 5. On the second quarter call, I told you that we were having an exceptional year and with three quarters of 2018 now logged that description is still on the mark. On the second quarter call, we significantly increased our earnings forecast for both GSP and our Power and Industrial business and that resulted in a $0.35 a share guidance increase on the mid-year call. Since then, we've had one of the warmest if not the warmest summer on record, which was clearly a huge boost to Electric Company revenues. And our Energy Trading business has turned in a strong performance. And so given this, we're increasing our 2018 operating EPS guidance midpoint by $0.17 to $6.30, which is our second significant guidance increase in as many quarters.We also had some notable operational and regulatory successes in the third quarter. Back in April, we received MPSC approval for our new roughly $1 billion Blue Water Energy Center, which is a natural gas combined-cycle power plant. And in August, we broke ground and began construction. The Blue Water will help us to meet our goal of reducing carbon emissions by more than 80%. In fact, the plant will represent our single largest step in reducing carbon emissions today as we retire three older coal-fired plants and startup what will be the most efficient power plant in Michigan and do all that simultaneously in the early 2020s.Another notable success occurred in September when we received a constructive order in our gas rate case. So, Jerry Norcia will provide some additional details on that order, but I'll just say that importantly, it will allow us to accelerate the replacement and strengthening of our gas distribution system. Now we spent a lot of time working with the MPSC staff on our gas main replacement plan and I think we landed via the order in a place that we both feel good about and feel is appropriate.Moving on to our non-utility businesses, at GSP in early October, we received FERC approval to place NEXUS in service. So, we began construction of NEXUS in October of last year, so essentially a year ago and construction went very smoothly and NEXUS is now flowing gas. And this is a significant milestone for us. It creates another platform to grow around as we have, for example, on the Bluestone platform and the Millennium platform. And those platforms provide low-cost, high-return investments that have made GSP a successful growth engine for the company over the past decade. And we're confident that NEXUS and the NEXUS platform will play that role in the decade ahead.Our P&I business continues to make progress in replacing the REF earnings that sunset in 2019 and 2021. Most recently, this progress is in the renewable natural gas space. So this year we started construction on an additional RNG project and completed the acquisition of another project. And so, we now have a total of seven RNG projects throughout the U.S. that supply pipeline quality renewable natural gas to markets to comply with a number of fuel standards, including those at the federal level in the State of California as well as the European standard. So we're going to review the details of P&I's long-term earnings plan at EEI in a few weeks. But I'll just say we're seeing a lot of growth potential in this area.",
                 'DRE': "Ronald HubbardThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.Before we make our prepared remarks today, let me remind you that statements we make are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.James ConnorThank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start out with a few comments on the national industrial markets and then cover our third quarter results. Vacancy across the U.S. declined slightly during the third quarter to 4.3%, creating a solid backdrop for pricing power, evidenced by year-to-date market rent growth approaching 6% nationally. Preliminary data shows third quarter absorption exceeded deliveries by about 12 million square feet, and the trend for the full year appears highly likely to support continued net positive absorption.Overall, new supply remains relatively in check, except for a few pockets, consistent with what we've noted throughout the year. In general, there continues to be a need for modern facilities in major markets for both e-commerce and traditional distribution across the entire logistics supply chain. Let me also touch on some of the recent macroeconomic and geopolitical headlines of late. Regarding tariffs, we are not seeing any material slowdown in decision-making from our customer base. From a practical standpoint, a 10% tariff on $200 billion of imports equates to $20 billion against a U.S. GDP of over $20.4 trillion. It's just not enough to slow our economy in any meaningful way. The tariff impact on some construction materials is consistent with what we've said the last few quarters. Steel costs are up about 15% year-over-year. Coupled with rising labor costs, overall construction costs are up 5% to 6%, similar to our previous statements. More importantly, we've been passing these marginal costs through the customers without a problem and maintaining our development margins.Specific to our portfolio, this relatively strong backdrop in market fundamentals continued with - coupled with continued expansion or execution by our regional operating teams contributed to the solid 5.2 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. Some of the more notable leases were with customers such as Home Depot, UPS Logistics, DHL, HD Supply and numerous third-party logistics firms.With the strong leasing activity and our stabilized industrial portfolio occupancy at 97.9%, we continue to be able to push rents, as indicated by our rent growth on new and renewal leases of roughly 28% on a straight-line basis and 11% on a cash basis. We reported 6.3% growth in cash same-property net operating income for the quarter. Same-property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was 4.6%.Third quarter same-property growth on a GAAP basis approximated our cash growth and about - is about 80 basis points better than cash on a year-to-year basis. Occupancy in the same-property pool of properties increased 150 basis points from the third quarter 2017 and increased 60 basis points from the 9-month period ending September 30 in 2017. This average same-property occupancy increase was the substantial driver in the quarterly same-property NOI increase compared with the previous two quarters. The occupancy was positively impacted by the very strong leasing executed in the first half of the year.More importantly, the strong leasing and strong rent growth this quarter and year-to-date have raised our expectations for full year same-property NOI growth, which Mark will discuss in a moment.On the development side of the business, momentum continued to be very good. During the third quarter, we generated $141 million of starts across six projects, totaling 2 million square feet that are 51% leased in aggregate. The new development starts included 618,000 square foot build-to-suit development in Cincinnati for a subsidiary of the Herman Miller Corporation.On the speculative development side, we started a project in the Inland Empire totaling 340,000 square feet. Shortly after commencing construction, we executed a lease for 100% of space for Legrand Holdings, a French industrial conglomerate. We started three other speculative development projects during the quarter in our Houston and Indianapolis markets totaling about 980,000 square feet. These facilities are located in our existing business park and adjacent to the major cargo airports.We continued to see strong activity in our development pipeline, and we're confident that we'll close out 2018 in strong fashion, and we're optimistic about early 2019.",
                 'DUK': "Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on recent activities, including our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also discuss our growth drivers for 2019 before closing with key investor considerations.With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.Let me begin on slide 4. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 compared to $1.59 in the prior year. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, supported by the outstanding work of our employees, who restored outages and back-to-back hurricanes over the last two months.As we look to the end of the year, we have narrowed our full year guidance to $4.65 to $4.85 per share, raising the midpoint and to the upper half of our original range. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2022, also midpoint of our 2017 guidance range. We continue to expect earnings growth at the low end of this range in 2019 and the mid to high end of the range in 2020 and beyond.In addition to strong financial results, we're pleased to highlight several recent recognitions for the company. Let me emphasize too that I know are important to our ESG investors. Duke Energy was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th consecutive year, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility. And Forbes named Duke Energy to their Global Best Employers list, which is based on rankings of publicly traded companies from 60 countries around the world. We're proud that our company and employees are being recognized for the work we do every day on behalf of our customers and communities.Turning to slide 5, I want to give you an update on our response to hurricanes Florence and Michael and in a moment Steve will share our thoughts on cost estimates and recovery. First, Hurricane Florence, this was a massive slow-moving storm that made landfall on the North Carolina coast in early September, causing widespread devastation and record setting rainfall. Ahead of the storm, we assembled our largest restoration force ever in the Carolinas, over 20,000 workers, to prepare and immediately begin restoring power when it was safe to do so.In addition, 2,000 employees outside of transmission and distribution volunteered to support our efforts from managing logistics to providing extra help, answering customer calls. We restored over 1.8 million outages in less than 10 days, with 93% restored in five days. Despite extensive flooding, the environment around our facilities, including ash basins remained well protected. This is a testament to our team's extensive preparation in advance of the storm and on the ground management throughout the heavy rainfall.Only weeks later, Hurricane Michael made landfall in early October on the Florida Panhandle. Michael triggered over 70,000 power outages in our Florida service territory before moving north and causing over 1.1 million outages in the Carolinas. More than 15,000 workers contributed to the restoration efforts with 90% of the outages restored within three days. All customers who could receive power were restored in five days in the Carolinas and eight days in Florida, but work continues in Florida as we rebuild our infrastructure in the most devastated areas.Our successful storm response was driven in part by lessons learned from previous storms and our investments to improve the grid. For example, in our DEP service territory, self-healing grid technologies rerouted power from damaged lines to minimize outages. We estimate that we avoided 27 million outage minutes across the Carolinas from the use of this technology during Hurricane Florence. Our grid improvement plan includes expansion of this technology to 80% of our customers over the next decade, up from 16% currently.",
                 'DXC': " Jonathan FordThank you and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased you are joining us for the DXC Technology, third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Our speakers on today's call will be Mike Lawrie, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer.The call is being webcast at dxc.com/investorrelations and we posted slides to our website which will accompany the discussion today.Slide two explains that the discussion will include comparisons of our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to our pro forma combined company results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The pro forma results are based on the historical quarterly statements of operations of each of CSC and the legacy Enterprise Services business of HPE or HPES, giving effect to the merger as if it had been consummated on April 2, 2016.As a consequence of CSC and HPES having different fiscal year-end dates, the pro forma combined company results include the results of operations of CSC for the three and nine months ending December 30, 2016 and of HPES for the three and nine months ending October 31, 2016.Slide three and four as our participant, the DXC Technology's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain further adjustment to these measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release, as well as in our supplemental slides. Both documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.On slide four you'll see that certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call.A discussion of risk and uncertainties is included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. I would like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law.And now I’d like to introduce DXC Technology's Chairman, President and CEO, Mike Lawrie. Mike LawrieOkay, thank you everyone and thanks for your interest in DXC. I know there is a lot going on today. As is my custom I will share four or five key points and then Paul will go into a little more detail and then we’ll open it up to any of your questions. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.15, adjusted EBIT was $927 million and adjusted EBIT margin was 15% and we generated $686 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter. Our revenue in the third quarter was $6.186 billion on a GAAP basis. All revenue comparisons exclude the impact of purchase price accounting and a one-time contract reset USPS last year. And on that basis revenue was down 4% year-over-year and was up 0.6% sequentially and in constant currency revenue was down 5.9% year-over-year and was up 0.8% sequentially. Sequential revenue growth reflects strong ad on in project sales in the quarter and our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1x. Our digital revenue grew 13% year-over-year and was down 3.3% sequentially reflecting contract milestone achievements in the second quarter. Year-to-date digital revenue was up 16%. Industry IP and BPS revenue was down 0.4% year-over-year and grew 1.1% sequentially. In the third quarter our digital book-to-bill was 1.1x and our industry IP and BPS book-to-bill was 1.6x, including a large BPS life insurance deal that was completed in the quarter. Now during the third quarter we continue to achieve merger integration milestones. We are on track to deliver $1.1 billion or more of year one cost savings, which implies roughly $1.6 billion of run rate cost savings exiting fiscal 2018. The separation of our U.S. public sector business and combination with Vencore and KeyPoint continues to progress. Today we filed the Form 10 and now expect the deal to close in May to allow the necessary SEC reviews. Finally for fiscal 2018 we continue to target revenue of $24 billion to $24.5 billion in constant currency and we are increasing our fiscal 2018 target on non-GAAP EPS to a range of $7.50 to $8, reflecting additional synergy realization this year, and our adjusted free cash flow target remains 90% of adjusted net income. Now let me go into a little more detail on each of those points. As I said, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $2.15. The effective tax rate was 28.7%. Third quarter adjusted EBIT was $927 million. Now adjusted EBIT margin was 15%. This was up 550 basis points year-over-year, and EBIT margin was up 180 basis points sequentially.

Good evening, and thank you for joining on our third quarter call. In September of 2016, we began a new journey at E*TRADE, a journey defined by a call to accelerate growth and to return to our roots as the undisputed leader for digitally-inclined traders and investors. Over the course of the last two years, we have made exceptional progress on this journey and we've created enormous value for our shareholders along the way. We've truly positioned the company for continued success and for sustainable long-term value creation.On behalf of E*TRADE’s leadership team, I look forward to expanding on these statements in more detail but will begin with an overview of tonight’s call. First, our Executive Chairman, Rodger Lawson will walk you through the board’s assessment of our performance and the impact of that assessment on the company’s future. Next, I will provide my thoughts on our progress and my team’s vision for the future of E*TRADE. Finally, Mike Pizzi will follow with an update on our capital allocation plans and summarize our Q3 results. Then, we will commence our customary Q&A. In addition for earnings press release, we have included supplementary pages in our investor presentation which highlights several of the key elements we will cover on the call this evening. It has been a very exciting and fulfilling two years and it is a pleasure to turn the page on this chapter in such a positive fashion and I look forward to sharing our vision for the future.With that, I will hand the call over to our Executive Chairman, Rodger Lawson.Rodger LawsonThank you, Karl, and good evening everyone. In the autumn of 2016, having announced the acquisition of OptionsHouse, the board set out a series of business driver relationship performance goals to serve as proof that we could reinvigorate growth, improve operating leverage and install a deeper sense of urgency in our ranks. As a board, we want the confirmation that E*TRADE had a bonafide long-term growth trajectory and could keep delivering meaningful value for our shareholders over time.As many of you know we also expressed if we couldn't achieve those goals over a reasonable period of time which we outlined as 18 to 24 months, we would consider other strategic options to protect and enhance shareholder value including a merger or even a sale of the company. Two years on, the company has clearly reinvigorated its growth and delivered outstanding returns. While the specific driver goals we set represent only one aspect of the company's strong performance, we are pleased with having outperformed on three of the four benchmarks we laid out.The area where we've fallen short is net new asset growth which has certainly improved but has lagged initial targets. We do recognize have of the shortfall is substantially due to our historical lack of institutional custody capability. Our acquisition and successful integration of TCA is quickly addressing some of that legacy gap, and Karl will tell more about why we are so optimistic about that opportunity.During the two-year period the board is evaluated E*TRADE not only against the full 2016 growth goals which has served as a guy posts of managing top line growth but also against other important dimensions of performance including earnings growth, ROE expansion and shareholder value creation all of which have exceeded our expectations.Here are a few of the comments we've noted during this period. The company has meaningfully elevated its offerings for derivative engaged traders above and beyond the capabilities we acquired with OptionsHouse. This has attracted more profitable trading activity and created a more resilient user base. We have seen the company's ability to grow and stock plan channel with a record increase and a number of new client wins. This is a critical growth engine for us as we look to our future.The team's successful integrated two acquisitions which is significantly expanded our capabilities on reach both for the present but also for the future.Management has consistently demonstrated an ability to quickly react to a very competitive market landscape while still expanding our share across our most profitable segments. There has also been great focus on operating discipline as well as revenue growth both of which are reflected in the expansion of E*TRADE’s operating margin.Overall, therefore, while looking broadly across E*TRADE or the specific business driver goals, the board is very pleased with the evolution and progress of the company over the past few years. It’s really been terrific. We're also very pleased with the total shareholder returns over that period during which we have significantly outpaced the performance of the market, the sector and our direct peers.We have also been very focused not just on the past but also growth prospects for the future. We believe this is critical to selecting the best path forward for E*TRADE and its shareholders. In looking at our future prospects, we have considered and placed substantial weight on the following areas: first, management's long-term strategic plan. The board's assessment of this multi-year plan is it's positive and not unreasonably optimistic, it is a sound incredible plan and should generate material value growth for E*TRADE.Second, the Board believes, after receiving analysis and advice from our third-party advisors, that with good execution management's plan, there is material shareholder value upside in E*TRADE’s future which is more compelling than what we believe will be generated from any likely near-term transaction. Critical elements in the assessment of management’s multi-year plan is follows.First, with approximately 6 million accounts and approaching a half a trillion in assets, the company has built significant scale across our areas of business. Beyond the current value profile of this base of customers and assets, we see meaningful potential to expand our products and, therefore, our engagements across this group which can drive substantial increase in value with just modest improvements. With the pending acquisition of roughly one million accounts from Cap One, this potential will only expand.",
                 'EMN': "We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Greg RiddleThank you, Cody, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Curt Espeland, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe, Manager, Investor Relations.Before we begin, I’ll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company’s third quarter 2018 financial results news release, during this call and in the accompanying slides, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2018 and the Form 10-Q to be filed for the third quarter 2018.Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain non-core and unusual items and have been adjusted for the forecasted tax rate as of the end of the interim periods. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the third quarter 2018 financial results news release, which can be found on our website, www.eastman.com in the Investors section. Projections of future earnings exclude any non-core unusual items and assume that the adjusted tax rate for first nine months 2018 will be the actual tax rate for the projected periods.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark.Mark CostaGood morning, everyone. I'll start on page 3. During the first nine months of the year, we delivered a 13% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS growth and our third quarter was in line with our expectations. We delivered strong volume growth with innovation driven mix improvement across our specialties, advanced materials and additives and functional products. We also delivered sequential earnings stability in fibers and stability in CI.The portfolio specialty businesses we've built is showing resiliency in the face of global uncertainty and we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth. Our innovation programs are the key to our success and we're seeing great progress on a number of fronts. For example, AM delivered 9% volume growth in the quarter and 7% through the first nine months, through attractive premium products like Tritan, Saflex heads up display interlayers and performance films, well above end market growth rates in transportation and consumer durables.In AFP, despite a tough comp from the large solar fills last year, volume growth increased 1% in the quarter and 6% through the first nine months. We continue to have double digit growth in product lines such as Impera tire resins, animal nutrition, water treatment, olefin polymers and adhesives, crop protection, plant growth regulators among others, which were driven by revenue synergies from our acquisitions.And in fibers, we're continuing our trend of delivering excellent revenue growth in textiles. Our innovative product offerings in acetated yarn delivered an exceptional revenue growth of 30% this quarter, giving us confidence that the fiber segment is stabilizing and we continue to be on track to deliver more than $350 million of new business closed this year across the company with the greater than 20% increase through the first 9 months.In a few moments, I’ll highlight a couple of examples of how we're executing our innovation driven growth model. Through relentless engagement in the market, our world class technology platforms and powerful application development, we're creating our own growth and winning with customers. On the cost management front, we remain focused in offsetting inflation with disciplined productivity savings.Free cash flow also remains a strength for us. Despite headwinds from higher raw materials, we have a path to deliver 1.1 billion in free cash flow this year. And we are allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined manner and aligning with our priorities. Through nine months, we've returned $615 million to shareholders, with $375 million of share repurchases and $240 million of dividends and we remain very committed to de-levering $300 million.Our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on what we can control, namely innovating through our enterprise and allocating our strong free cash flow in a disciplined way. On slide 4, a key driver of success and growing our specialty business is not only creating new product innovation, but improving our commercial execution and driving revenue synergies from our acquisitions.Our teams continue to make great progress of delivering synergies from the Taminco acquisition. In addition to markets such as animal nutrition or crop protection, which we've highlighted in the past, our chemicals business is delivering strong growth. Authorities around the world including China are in the process of adopting more stringent, environmental laws that require state-of-the-art water treatment solutions for the industrial municipal water treatment applications.",
                 'ETN': "Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. PlcGood morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As all of you that are on the call have noticed, today our call is occurring at 11 AM versus our traditional 10 start. We moved our call today to allow those of you who follow Cummins to participate in their call, which occurred at 10 AM this morning. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.Our agenda today as typical includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for 2018 and a preliminary look at 2019. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.The press release from the earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is going to be available on our website and will be available for replay after the earnings is complete.Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to forward-looking future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results can differ from those forecasted projections due to a range of items covered in the uncertainties covered in our press release, presentation and on the 8-K.And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. PlcOkay. Thanks, Don. Hey, let me begin with a quick summary of our Q3 results. And overall it was a solid quarter where our balance across multiple end markets really allowed the company to deliver strong results and so we're really pleased with our Q3 results.Earnings per share of $0.95 on a GAAP basis or $1.43 excluding the impact of the arbitration decision we previously announced in August. This is towards the upper end of our guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 and up 14% above prior year, excluding naturally the gain from the JV that we formed last year in Q3. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 4%, and this was comprised of 6% organic growth offset by 1% each from both currency and some small divestitures we had during the course of last year.We're very pleased with our strong margin performance, which included an all-time record margins of 17.6%. Our teams really executed well, which led to all-time record margins in three of our segments including; Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. And finally, we produced solid operating cash flows of $1 billion in the quarter.On page 4, we compare our performance of the quarter versus prior year and I'll just highlight a couple of items here. Notice that sales were up 4% and strong execution, segment operating margins were up 120 basis points over prior year and we posted 11% increase in segment operating profits.We did have two unusual items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in Q3 2017 and the expenses from the arbitration decision in Q3 2018. Excluding these items, net income was also up 11%.On page 5, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were flat with organic growth of 1%, offset by 1% currency. And I'll just note here that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the Lighting business. As we discussed in prior calls, in the Lighting business organic revenues declined slightly in the quarter, in line with declines that we've seen in Q2 and excluding Lighting, Electrical Products had 3% organic growth. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in North America with particular strength and solid growth in the industrial end markets.We had expected our Lighting sales to turn positive in the quarter and we do believe this will happen next quarter. This assumption is also supported by the growth that we saw in our orders during the course of Q3. Overall orders increased 3% for the segment with solid growth in industrial and residential markets in North America. And our backlog is up some 16% over last year. So we're pleased to see the really strong strength and building backlogs during the course of the quarter. Segment operating profits increased 4%, with operating margins up 70 basis points to once again an all-time record of 19.2%.",
                 'EBAY': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Selim Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. You may now begin.Selim Freiha - eBay, Inc.Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us and welcome to eBay's earnings release conference call for the third quarter of 2018. Joining me today on the call are Devin Wenig, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Schenkel, our Chief Financial Officer.We're providing a slide presentation to accompany Scott's commentary during the call. All revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Devin and Scott's prepared remarks represent FX-Neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise. This conference call is also being broadcast on the internet, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of the eBay website at investors.ebayinc.com. You can visit our Investor Relations website for the latest company news and updates. In addition, an archive of the webcast will be accessible for at least three months through the same link.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include but are not limited to statements regarding the future performance of eBay Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries including expected financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 and the future growth in our business.Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call for a variety of reasons. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the company's Investor Relations website at investors.ebayinc.com or the SEC's website at sec.gov. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of October 30, 2018, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information.With that, let me turn the call over to Devin.Devin Wenig - eBay, Inc.Thanks, Selim. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, total GMV was up 5% and revenue was up 6% while our active buyer base grew 4% to 177 million. Underlying these results, GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 5%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 11%. Scott will go into more detail on our financial results in his section.We continue to make foundational investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace this quarter while setting the stage for significant growth opportunities in Payments and Advertising. New eBay users are responding well to the evolution of our platform, but as we mentioned last quarter, our existing buyer base has been slower to adapt to these changes. This has limited our ability to scale some new experiences and as we planned coming into Q3, we made significant marketing investments this quarter, with a focus on buyer incentives and top-of-funnel activities such as our brand campaign.While some of these activities were successful and will scale, others did not deliver a sufficient return. These dynamics, coupled with the impact of a strong dollar on our U.S. export business, led to a 2-point deceleration in Marketplace volume growth this quarter. Setting eBay up for future growth requires us to continue to build a comprehensive catalog, further simplify and improve the user experience, and address customer imperatives such as trust in shipping.It also requires that we redefine perceptions of eBay's brand and business. Given that we have a large stable and successful business but must also build for the future, we're shifting our tactics to balance the needs of a habituated base of customers who are used to shopping on eBay a certain way while pursuing an even larger base of potential customers who have different expectations. We'll continue to focus on delivering significant product experience changes for new customers while evolving the experience for our existing base of users at a more measured pace.Similarly, we'll continue to market our brand, but we plan to target our marketing to focus more heavily on acquiring new buyers while reducing our overall investment. We expect that this will result in slower growth for a period of time as we grow our user base and change the mix of customers. However, this will also allow us to deliver strong earnings growth over this period of time through operational margin expansion and ongoing aggressive capital return while positioning the business for stronger growth in 2020 as Payments and Advertising continue to ramp.",
                 'ECL': "It is now my pleasure to introduce Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you Mr. Monahan you may now begin.Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most recent Form 10-K, in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.Starting with a brief overview of the results. Ecolab's solid growth momentum continued in the third quarter. New business gains, accelerating pricing and product innovation drove strong third quarter acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all of our business segments. That strong top line growth along with cost efficiency and reduced tax rate yielded the third quarter's 11% adjusted earnings per share increase.Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 7% with strong growth across all business segments. Regionally sales growth was led by North America and Latin America. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 6% continuing the acceleration shown throughout 2018. The operating income gain along with the lower tax rate yielded 11% increase in third quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share.We continue to work aggressively to drive growth winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing productivity and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also continue to see solid underlying sales volume and pricing across all of our business segments.However after offsetting the bulk of $0.75 per share of increased delivered product cost and currency exchange headwinds since our initial 2018 forecast, we expect the fourth quarter will see further significant increases that leave insufficient time to offset them this year. We now expect 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 11% to 13% to the $5.20 to $5.30 range as volume and price gains offset the impact of higher delivered product cost and business investments. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be up 8% to 15% to the $1.49 to $1.59 range. Work on the previously announced $200 million cost savings initiative, which is leveraging our recent technology and systems investments is making good progress and will benefit the fourth quarter.In summary, we expect continued strong top line momentum in our business over the balance of the year to more than offset higher costs and deliver operating income growth and along with cost efficiency actions and a lower tax rate yield 11% to 13% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth this year. Importantly despite the significant headwinds we are continuing to make the right investments in key areas of differentiation, including product innovation and digital investments to develop superior growth for the future and we expect to sustain strong momentum as we exit the year.And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.Thanks Mike. In short, I'm happy with our business performance. I'm not happy at all that we had to lower our guidance, but the story isn't very complicated. The business results are strong. Volume growth, pricing, innovation, new business cost savings are all meeting our ambitious targets. Organic sales were plus 7% for the third quarter. We expect equal or better in Industrial, Institutional and other in Q4 compared to their Q3 results. The exception will be Energy, which is mostly a comparison issue. It's going against a 12% Q4 last year which we had said at the time was onetime driven.Pricing also accelerated again in Q3 across the board and will again in Q4, so we will leave the year at a 3% clip. Everything else operationally is in line also, including cost savings. The unexpected was principally raw material costs, which continued to defy gravity indices and certainly our projections. In total raws were $0.11 more than we had last forecast and FX piled on for another $0.04. Nearly three-quarters of this hits Q4.",
                 'EIX': "Sam Ramraj - Edison InternationalThank you, Ash, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Pedro.Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison InternationalWell, thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter core earnings were $1.56 per share, $0.12 higher than the same period last year. This was mainly due to the regulatory deferral of certain O&M costs and tax benefits at SCE, partially offset by lower tax benefits at EIX Parent and Other. Please remember this comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE he has not received a decision in its 2018 General Rate Case. Maria will provide more detail in her remarks.As we continue to wait on proposed decisions and rulings from key proceedings, I would like to update you on some significant events that occurred in the third quarter.On the legislative front, during the 2018 session, we advocated for reforms to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires and fairly allocate financial responsibility among the multiple causes which contribute to wildfires. We focused on four key principles. The first was the establishment of an objective of wildfire management plan to guide system investments and new operating protocols. This would create more transparency and clarity with regard to prudency. The second principle was reform of inverse condemnation to transition from strict liability regardless of fault to a reasonableness standard. The third principle was reforming the current cost recovery structure at the CPUC to incorporate the concept that disallowance must be proportionate to the utility's contribution to a fire.Finally we emphasize the continued importance of financially healthy utilities to meet California's ambitious climate change policies. With the end of the 2018 legislative session, I wanted to briefly review the key actions taken.Senate Bill 901 was the most significant wildfire policy bill signed this year. We appreciate the legislature's attention to this critical and complex issue. Climate change has resulted in long-term drought conditions that weaken and kill trees due to bark beetle infestation and more severe weather events. At the same time, dry vegetation increases fuel on the ground which increases the risks of devastating wildfires. SB 901 includes many elements related to vegetation management and land use practices that will help mitigate this risk. Beyond that, the bill includes four key elements: wildfire mitigation plans, wildfire cost recovery considerations, securitization, and a 2017 stress test. The wildfire mitigation plans and cost recovery considerations are two constructive elements that increase clarity for the prudent manager standard and improve the regulatory construct to appropriately allocate financial responsibility. However, further work is required to establish a set of prudent manager standards for wildfire prevention and event response and reform current policies on post-event liability. These are essential to fairly balancing risk for Californians in the future.The bill also establishes the Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to identify additional elements that address the ever-increasing threat posed by wildfires in California including the equitable socialization of wildfire costs. The committee will be comprised of five members, three of whom will be appointed by the new governor. SCE will work with stakeholders as a thought partner and a resource as the state continues to address these issues.Mitigation and prevention are the best defenses against future wildfires. In September, SCE filed its Grid Safety and Resiliency Program application. This was the result of an internal effort to review and strengthen our wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts in response to the new normal. Our approach aligns with the wildfire mitigation plans required by Senate Bill 901. This $582 million program proposes $407 million of capital spending in three key areas: grid hardening, operational enhancements, and situational awareness.Most of the capital spend request is related to a covered conductor program to help mitigate the risk of ignitions in high fire risk areas. Our risk analysis has shown this to be more prudent from a cost-benefit perspective than other options. The requested program will replace 600 circuit miles of bare wire in high fire risk areas with insulated wire in the 2018 and 2020 period. SCE has identified another approximately 3,400 circuit miles of bare overhead conductor in high fire risk areas that will also merit re-conductoring beyond 2020 through future GRCs. Further, the request includes capital investment and O&M for several other areas that help reduce the risk of wildfire ignition. These requests are incremental to those contained in our pending 2018 GRC application. While we are in the initial phase of the proceeding, we believe these expenditures are necessary and have therefore started investing moderate amounts on these programs without waiting for CPUC review of our application.",
                 'EW': 'I will now turn the conference over to your host, David Erickson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.David EricksonWelcome, and thank you for joining us today. Just after the close of regular trading, we released our third quarter 2018 financial results. During today’s call, we’ll discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A.Our presenters on today’s call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; and Scott Ullem, CFO.Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during today’s call we will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include but aren’t limited to financial guidance, expectations for product opportunities, clinical trials, litigation, new product approvals, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them after today.Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in our press release, our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, all of which are available on our website at Edwards.com.Also, a quick reminder that when we use the terms underlying, organic and adjusted, we are referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, we are referring to our GAAP results. Additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures is included in today’s press release and our website.And now, I’ll turn the call over to Mike Mussallem. Mike?Michael MussallemThank you, David. We’re pleased to report strong third quarter adjusted sales of $921 million, or a 11% growth on an underlying basis consistent with our expectations, driven by a remarkable portfolio of innovative technologies.Year-to-date, underlying sales growth was 10%, and it was consistent with our full-year guidance of 10% to 11%. And even with the backdrop of a tough fourth quarter comparison, we expect 2018 to be a year of strong financial performance, while also aggressively investing in our future.Looking forward, based on recent learnings, we have increased confidence that our innovative lifesaving therapies can benefit many more patients whose structural heart disease is deadly and undertreated today.In transcatheter heart valve therapy, global third quarter sales were $558 million. Underlying sales were up 12.7% compared to the prior year, which reflects continued impressive organic growth. We estimate global TAVR procedures continued to grow robustly in the mid-teens.Our worldwide sales grew at a lower rate due to a modest year-over-year share decline outside the U.S. and lower royalty revenues. Globally, our average selling price remained stable.In the U.S., total procedures for the third quarter grew in the mid-teens versus the prior year, and our growth was comparable. Growth was highest in newer and smaller centers, where this therapy is increasingly accessible to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.Based on our continued research, we are increasingly confident that there are many patients who would benefit from TAVR who are not diagnosed or treated today. We’re continuing our efforts to increase awareness, improve diagnosis and help patients receive the care specified in medical guidelines.Late in the third quarter, we began enrolling our limited Continued Access Protocol, or CAP, for our U.S. PARTNER 3 trial, which have a minimal impact on this quarter’s results. And we continue to anticipate data from the PARTNER 3 trial to be presented at the ACC meeting in March of 2019, followed by the receipt of a low-risk indication late that year.Earlier this month, we announced the commencement of the U.S. pivotal trial that will study our self-expanding CENTERA transcatheter valve for patients at intermediate risk of open-heart surgery. And we expect the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system to gain U.S. regulatory approval around the end of the year.Following a public comment period and a review of TAVR outcomes at the Medicare Advisory Committee meeting in July, CMS is currently in the process of formulating a draft provision of the National Coverage Determination, or NCD. This reconsideration is critically important for U.S. patient seeking treatment for this deadly disease.We assume any changes to the current NCD are likely to significantly affect the global TAVR opportunity. We expect the new NCD to be finalized by June 2019. Outside the U.S., procedure showed significant continued growth estimated to be in the mid-teens. Our procedures grew in the low double digits. We continue to see excellent long-term opportunities for growth, as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy is still low.',

Q3 was a quarter defined by strong performances and important learnings for us at Electronic Arts. We love making games. It is a privilege to bring fun and entertainment to people all around the world. As we look across our games and services this quarter, we have a lot to be proud of. We brought hundreds of millions of hours of play to fans during the holiday quarter across console, mobile and PC. We also appreciate that our players have high expectations of us and the games we make and that passion drives us. As we push the boundaries with every new experience, we are continually listening, learning and taking action to serve our players.Now, let me touch on Star Wars Battlefront II. This was definitely a learning opportunity. You'll remember that we brought three of our top studios together on this project, and the result was a massive game with a new Star Wars story; space battles; and huge multiplayer variety. We wanted a game that would meet the needs of the vast and passionate Star Wars fan base, so we designed it with the intent of keeping the community together, and a commitment to continually add content long after launch. Given the newness of this design, we knew that player feedback during the pre-launch testing period would be key. Having made adjustments based on sentiment and community data coming out of the beta and early trials, we ultimately made the decision to pull in game purchases out of the game prior to launch. We never intended to build an experience that could be seen as unfair or lacking clear progression, so we removed the feature that was taking away from what fans were telling us was an otherwise great game. We are fortunate to have such passionate players that will tell us when we get it right, and when we don't.We're now working hard on more updates that will meet the needs of our players, and we hope to bring these to the Battlefront II community in the months ahead. Having made these changes before launch, Star Wars Battlefront II has been delivering fun to millions of players around the world, through the holiday season and beyond. With the breadth and depth of the game, fans spent twice as much time playing Battlefront II over the previous game during the launch quarter. The unique story of Iden Versio at the center of the game has drawn nearly 70% of players into the single -player campaign. Engagement has been strong in the first season of free post- launch content from The Last Jedi, and we're excited to bring new seasons to fans in FY19.As we grow this game with more content, we believe that Star Wars fans will continue to have fantastic experiences over the long life of Battlefront II. Going forward, we believe that live services that include optional digital monetization, when done right, provide a very important element of choice that can extend and enhance the experience in our games. We're committed to continually working with our players to deliver the right experience in each of our games and live services.",
                 'EMR': "Emerson's commentary in responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.Thank you very much, Rocco. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, Executive President, Emerson Automation Solutions; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions. Welcome to Emerson's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website.Let's start with the third quarter summary on slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $4.5 billion increased 10% with underlying sales up 8%. Demand conditions remained favorable and trailing three-month underlying orders continue to trend in the 5% to 10% range with June orders up 9%. Profitability improved across all metrics with gross margin up 220 basis points and EBIT margin up 180 basis points. Price/cost was slightly positive in the quarter.GAAP EPS was $1.12, including a $0.24 tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this benefit, EPS was $0.88, up 40% compared with the prior year. Q3 cash flow was very strong. Free cash flow of $804 million is 18% of sales and free cash flow conversion was over 110% in the quarter.We've continued to buy back shares. In Q3, we repurchased 3.7 million shares. Year-to-date, we've repurchased over 15 million shares for a total of $1 billion and we've returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.Turning to slide 4, third quarter gross margin was up 220 basis points. This improvement includes a tailwind from prior year Valves & Controls purchase accounting charges. This tailwind was partially offset by timing of the V&C acquisition, which closed in late April last year, resulting in two months of dilution from the acquisition last year versus three months this year.On a comparable basis, that is, excluding the impact of the prior-year purchase accounting charge and the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, gross margin was up 180 basis points.Reported EBIT margin was up 180 basis points and on a comparable basis was up 140 basis points. Again, that is excluding the prior year purchase accounting charge and the extra month of V&C dilution this year.Turning to slide 5, from a geographic perspective, the momentum we've seen this past year continued in Q3 with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Mature markets were up high-single digits led by North America. Europe returned to growth in Q3 after a flat first half, reflecting steady growth in air conditioning and refrigeration markets and improving trends in key process automation markets. Emerging markets were up high-single digits in the quarter led by Asia. Latin America grew 7% after being down slightly in the first half, reflecting favorable trends across both business platforms.Turning now to slide 6, total segment margin was up 40 basis points, including the aforementioned timing impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, total segment margin was up 100 basis points.Operating cash flow was up 19% to $924 million driven by high quality earnings and strong working capital performance. Trade working capital improved 150 basis points driven by receivables and inventory improvement.Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. Strong growth continues to be driven by MRO, small and mid-sized projects and turnaround activity across our key end markets. North America continued the trends we saw in the first half with both the U.S. and Canada up in the mid-teens. China likewise continued strong growth with broad-based investment and project wins across our key end markets. Outside of China, modest growth continued across the rest of Asia supported by solid MRO demand and improving investment activity, especially in India.Europe turned positive this quarter after being flat through the first half reflecting oil and gas investment in Eastern Europe and improving industrial investment across Eastern and Western Europe. Latin America was positive this quarter after being down slightly in the first half, and the region continues to show some signs of stabilizing and improving. Middle East and Africa growth was supported by strong MRO and improving investment across the region.Automation Solutions segment margin was up 170 basis points including the timing impact of the V&C acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, segment margin was up 250 basis points. This improvement was driven by leverage, the benefit of prior period restructuring actions and operational improvements at Valves & Controls.Now please turn to slide 8 and I will hand the call over to Mr. Mike Train.Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.Thanks, Tim. Pleasure to join the call again. Steven had asked me to provide a little bit of an update on our large project funnel, we shared that with you at the February investor meeting and we've updated it for today's discussion.On slide 8, you'll see for August 2018 we're at about $6.8 billion in funnel size. That has increased significantly since the February timeframe. We've seen projects going into the funnel really across all the different industry types that are listed there. I would say at this stage of the game, we're probably not anticipating the funnel to grow anymore given that there're smaller projects that don't make the funnel and there's investment decision dates beyond 2020. Right now, I think this is a very good set of projects that we're working with.There have been awards against this funnel probably on the order of $700 million to $800 million that we've been tracking over these last six months. Emerson has won a good number of those. I'm very satisfied with our hit rate on those awards. And generally, those have to be engineered by EPCs before they become orders and then ultimately become sales rec. So there's still a little bit of that out in front of us for the large part.We are seeing great take-up at our main valve partner concept. We've launched that here in the last year. Talking to customers as we've built up larger Final Control business. We are already seeing some very serious discussions around that and I think there's going to be end users and engineering contractors that want to take advantage of that.All in all, I think again the project pace is strong. I think the activities are there. I've been around the world twice in the last four months, talking with EPCs and customers. We see customers stationed at the EPCs. They're doing the pre-work, the pre-feed, the feed work. And it looks pretty robust I think as we look forward. So that is slide 8.Slide 9, I just wanted to kind of pull in some other indicators from around the industry, if you will. Left-hand side talks to the CapEx across the oil and gas value chain. So it's the upstream, the midstream and the downstream. And really based on what we're seeing in the global data, we are seeing that CapEx numbers are starting to lean forward, grow positively. I think there's outlook and expectations for that. I think those will firm up as people start talking about their 2019 year here in the next quarter or two.",
                 'ETR': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. David Borde, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Borde, you may begin.David BordeThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results. [Operator Instructions]. In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in today's press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.Leo DenaultThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We now have 3 quarters behind us, and we continue to consistently execute on the initiatives that keep us on track to achieve our goals, both near term and longer term. We've completed most of the 2018 key deliverables we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we've added a few more since then. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS of $2.27 and consolidated operational earnings per share of $3.77. Drew will cover the numbers in more detail, but the bottom line is, that we're raising our consolidated operational guidance range. For our UP&O adjusted view, we are affirming our 2018 guidance and our longer-term outlooks through 2021. With the EEI Financial Conference less than 2 weeks away, we are keeping today's call focused on the quarter. Before I go into our accomplishments, I'd to address a couple of news items that while not materially impacting financial results weren't being addressed. First, on the Mississippi Attorney General complaint. This is the continuation of litigation that was filed 10 years ago. The matter was set to go to trial in early November, but as you may have heard earlier this week, the trial was continued to sometime next year. The precise date has not been set. We filed 2 separate motions for summary judgment, and last June, the State of Mississippi passed legislation, which clarifies that a claim of this nature should first proceed in front of the NPSE before being filed in court. This matter has been disclosed and thoroughly discussed in our 10-K and 10-Q filings to which I would point you. The important thing for you to takeaway is that our generation practices are scrutinized, reviewed or audited in multiple jurisdictions on a regular and continuous basis and have been for decades. Claims similar to those brought by the Attorney General were alleged in Louisiana, New Orleans and Texas. Louisiana commission and City Council both rejected those claims on their merits, and the case was dismissed in Texas for lack of jurisdiction. We feel very comfortable about our position in the litigation, and for that reason, do not believe the lawsuit poses a material risk to earnings. Second, we received the shared Gartner report on the grassroots advocacy practices in New Orleans. We recognized and appreciate the effort undertaking by the City Council to thoroughly review this matter. Nevertheless, we take exception to certain characterizations and key omissions in the report, like the Hawthorn Group's written admission that they took these actions without our knowledge. There are no facts that support the conclusion that Entergy employees knew about the hiring of crowds on demand or their payments to individuals to show support for the New Orleans power station. However, we believe that better oversight and asking the right questions could have either prevented the actions of Hawthorn and crowds on demand or discovered them and allowed us to stop them. We continue our effort to regain the trust and confidence of the citizens of New Orleans and the Council.I will now turn back to the quarter. With good clarity on our strategy, our accomplishments included a major milestone in our transition to a pure-play utility. The NRC has approved the license transfer of Vermont Yankee to NorthStar. This was a necessary condition in our agreement to sell Vermont Yankee along with it's decommissioning assets and liability. The decision is also an important milestone for the nuclear decommissioning industry, and we are pleased with this outcome and encouraged by the NRC's acceptance of this transaction model. The sale of nuclear plants post-shutdown will benefit stakeholders and our industry by accelerating the decommissioning time line, drawing on industry-leading decommissioning and site remediation expertise and experience and laying the foundation for potential future business development opportunities in the regions. We are awaiting a decision from the Vermont Public Utility Commission, which we requested by November 30. We continue to target completion of the transaction by year-end.",
                 'EOG': "Good day, everyone, and welcome to EOG Resources Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; David Trice, EVP Exploration & Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration & Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; and David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations.Here's Bill Thomas.William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone. EOG is a high-return organic growth company and we are delivering what we promised: a compelling combination of high returns, disciplined growth and free cash flow. In the third quarter, we lowered well costs and improved well performance. As a result, year-to-date, we are generating triple-digit well level returns.We grew our oil production 27% year-over-year and total production 25%. And we generated over $0.5 billion in free cash flow. This is a rare performance not often seen in our industry or even in the broader market.Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG's unique culture of innovation, supported by a rich history of a data-driven, non-bureaucratic flat organization. Innovations, real-time data gathering, rapid analytics and redeployment of learnings to the field are continually producing improving results through the company.For example, in the Delaware Basin, we are making significant progress in breaking the code for optimum well spacing. Likewise, on the cost side, we are making significant progress driving down drilling and completion costs. The same is true for our Woodford Oil Play, where just like in the Delaware, we're finding better drilling targets, discovering improved completion techniques and lowering costs all at the same time.We're excited about our progress and the continuous improvements we are seeing this year. And more importantly, we believe there's plenty of momentum to continue to get better in 2019. EOG's unique culture of innovation and focus on exploration are fundamental to our sustainable business model. Our culture of innovation drives continuous improvements in each play we develop, maximizing the value of our leasehold by optimizing NPV, returns and finding and development costs.Our focus on organic exploration makes EOG a prospect-generating machine, and we continue to generate significant new ideas. And to be clear about it, we're only interested in adding new plays that will increase the quality of our premium inventory, and we're encouraged with the new prospects we're currently evaluating.Innovation and exploration are key to EOG's sustainable business model and creates long-term value for our shareholders. We're on track to deliver double-digit ROC and strong double-digit production growth in 2018. Those two milestone achievements, combined with returning cash to shareholders through a 31% increase in the dividend this year, debt reduction and the generation of substantial free cash flow make EOG a unique and compelling investment, not only in the E&P industry, but in the broader market.Looking forward to 2019, we're not going to increase capital at the expense of efficiencies and returns. We will develop our assets and spend capital at a pace that will optimize our learning curve and allow sustainable improvement to our well productivity and cost structure. Any production growth is strictly the result of disciplined capital allocation to high return assets. Furthermore, capital allocation will continue to be based on returns measured against our premium price deck of $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas prices, no matter if commodity prices improve next year. Our goal of being one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market has not changed. We are continuously resetting the company to deliver strong returns, even in a low to moderate oil price environment.Next up is Billy to discuss third quarter highlights that are the results of a well-executed capital and operational plan and how we plan to maintain that performance for the remainder of the year and into 2019.",
                 'EFX': "Trevor Burns - Equifax IncorporatedThanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full-year guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incidents, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance technology and data security.This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as our projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security are expected to occur throughout 2018, 2019 and into 2020.Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes the cost related to the agreement in principle to settle class action lawsuits related to reporting a civil judgments and tax claims on our credit files.We reported a charge of $18.5 million in the third quarter with an adjusted EPS impact at about $11.50 per share. Details of this agreement will also be included in our third quarter 10-Q.Adjusted EBITDA is also defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization; income tax expense; and also as the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items including cost related to cybersecurity incident, cost related to the agreement and principle to settle class action lawsuits and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In the Form 10-Q, which we will disclose that future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations associated with last year's cybersecurity incident are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this stage in the proceedings.Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. We continue to make positive steps in the third quarter towards returning to a normal selling relationship with our U.S. customers, while investing heavily in technology, security and customer support and transformational investments. Our significant multiyear investments in technology and data security are critical to our long-term success and will differentiate Equifax in the future.Our financial performance in the quarter was solid as we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.41 per share which is at the midpoint of our range. Revenue for the quarter of $834 million reflects local currency revenue growth of 2%, which was consistent with the second quarter, but below our expectations and yours for revenue growth in the quarter. In excess of a-third of this revenue growth versus our expectation reflects the weaker-than-expected U.S. mortgage market as well as weaker credit markets in Australia and the well-known economic conditions in Argentina.Importantly for us in the quarter, USIS posted positive revenue growth for the first time since the cybersecurity incident despite the weakness in the U.S. mortgage market. And equally important EWS growth approached to strong 9%, a really strong performance by both businesses as they continue to focus on the future.Currency continues to be substantial headwind for our business, negatively impacting revenue by over 200 basis points and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 a share versus third quarter 2017. Versus our expectations for the third quarter, currency negatively impacted revenue by about 50 basis points or $4 million and adjusted EPS by over $0.05.USIS revenue was up slightly versus last year compared to the down 1% to 2% we saw in the last three quarters. This is a solid performance in a very positive step forward for our U.S. business as we work towards returning to a more normal growth mode with our customers.We also saw growth in online information services, which was also up 1% versus last year. These are both really important milestones for us, which were achieved despite the mortgage market headwind, where inquiries were down over 10% in the quarter, which negatively impacted overall U.S. revenue by 3%. So that positive performance with that headwind was a real positive for us.While we show this momentum in sequential improvement the USIS revenue, the performance was below what we expected and John will provide some more details on that later in the discussion.In the third quarter, the vast majority of our commercial relationships in the United States returned to more normal growth mode, which is allowing us to return to working collaboratively with our customers to pursue expanded and new solutions that will drive their business forward and create revenue opportunities for Equifax.We have now a very small handful and I would say less than one hand of customers where we're still completing security reviews to address any remaining open items from the cybersecurity incident in 2017.Our sales teams are successfully re-engaging and our pipelines are building in the U.S. However, as expected and as we discussed previously, sales cycles are extended and can be unpredictable. Sales cycles historically have range from 6 months and can be as long as 12 months including customer integration.And as we discussed last quarter and prior quarters, these impacts on the sales cycles are having an impact on the pace of USIS' return to a more normal growth mode particularly in Financial Marketing Services. It will beat sales cycle impacts in the third quarter resulted in a 2% decline in Financial Marketing Services, which was weaker than our expectations as we had forecasted growth by that team.Like in the third quarter, we saw a handful of contracts in that space that closed or are closing in October versus September, which is a reflection of the pace of this recovery and also the unpredictability of the business as we work through that recovery.As in the third quarter, I'm continuing to spend a significant amount of my time with Paulino and his USIS team working with their customers as we return USIS to a more normal mode of commercial activity.I met with over 30 U.S. customers in the last 90 days and will continue to spend a large portion of my time with our customers as we continue to return to a more normal growth mode. I was with a big customer in Texas last Friday and another big customer this week on Monday and our customers' perspectives are consistent and invaluable. They value our differentiated assets in the United States, they are supportive of our significant investments in technology and data security and they're ready to return and are returning to a more normal growth mode with us.",
                 'EQIX': "I would now turn the call over to Ms. Katrina Rymill, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.Katrina Rymill - Equinix, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2018, and 10-Q filed on August 8, 2018. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an exclusive public disclosure.In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on our IR page of the website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time-to-time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call within an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one.At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.Charles J. Meyers - Equinix, Inc.Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I am privileged to host my first call today as CEO and I feel honored to lead the incredible team of nearly 8,000 dedicated Equinix employees around the globe in service to each other, to our customers, and to our shareholders. I am as excited as ever about the role we play in helping customers drive their digital transformation agenda and about the value creation opportunity this represents for our investors. Having been a part of the leadership team at Equinix for the past eight years, I am extremely proud of our track record of success. We have more than quadrupled the size of our business since 2010, have now deployed over $22 billion of capital across the globe to build the world's leading interconnection platform, and we are rapidly emerging as the trusted center of a cloud-first world. As stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, our priority is and will remain delivering exceptional, durable, and quantifiable value to our customers.In doing so, we believe we can sustain a demonstrably superior business model, which will in turn deliver outsized returns for our shareholders. I'm fortunate to build further on this strong foundation and as a global team, we will certainly remain focused on extending our core sources of differentiation: superior global reach, market-leading network and cloud density, the industry's most comprehensive interconnection portfolio, scaled digital ecosystems, and an unwavering commitment to service excellence. But I also recognize that we must continue to adapt and evolve in response to the rapidly changing needs of our market. We will continue to refine our priorities for the business as we shape our operating plan and prepare to update you on our 2019 guidance early next year.However, I want to outline six immediate priorities that are worth noting as central elements of our go-forward agenda. First, we will expand our go-to-market engine, investing behind the significant momentum we have, helping customers, implement hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. Second, we'll evolve our capabilities and product portfolio to make Equinix more powerful, easier to use, more accessible platform to drive digital transformation, delivering new services that will help us sustain and enhance cabinet yields over the coming years.Third, we will look to more deeply engage a shortlist of high priority partners that we believe can substantially extend our solution and amplify our go-to-market reach. Fourth, we will significantly sharpen our focus on driving increased operating leverage to enable investments in the business, drive long-term margin expansion, and fuel AFFO per share. Fifth, we'll focus on delivering against our hit strategy, allowing us to advance our global leadership in the cloud ecosystem, while reducing strain on our balance sheet. And finally, and most importantly, we will continue to invest in our people and our culture as the primary engine behind our sustained performance.As we execute against these priorities, we will be appropriately sensitive to near-term results, but our focus, as it always has been, will remain firmly on the creation of sustainable long-term value, and as appropriate, we will not shy away from investments in the business when we are confident that those investments will generate an outsized return.",
                 'EQR': "Marty McKennaThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2018 operating results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Mark Parrell, our President; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.And now, I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut.David NeithercutThank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for today's call. As we reported in last night’s earnings release with the primary leasing season in the rear view mirror, we’re pleased to now expect to deliver same store revenue growth for the full year of 2.3%, which is at the very top of the guidance range we provided on most recent earnings call in late July.Achieving this level of growth is the result of a couple of primary drivers, the continued strong demand across the board for rental housing and the relentless attention to customers' service delivery each and every day by our outstanding property management teams. These two factors combined to maintain very high levels of occupancy, record setting resident retention and very strong renewal rates, all despite elevated levels of new supply across our markets. We could not be more proud of our teams across the country for the outstanding jobs they do, making living with equity a remarkable experience with each and every one of our residents.I'll now ask our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Manelis, to go into greater detail on what we are seeing across our markets today.Michael ManelisOkay. Thank you, David. So let me being with a huge shout out to our onsite teams. The third quarter represents our busiest activity period with just over one third of the entire year's renewal and new leases taking place. The team's performance and relentless focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our residents delivered outstanding results for the quarter. With just over 24,000 transactions completed during the third quarter, we achieved a 5.1% increase on renewals, and a 1.2% increase on new leases signed. This, along with maintaining our occupancy at 96.2%, has delivered third quarter revenue growth of 2.3%, which as David said, now gives us the confidence that our full-year 2018 revenue growth will be 2.3%, which is the top of our previous reported range.I would also like to highlight that the 16.4% turnover for the quarter is the lowest third quarter turnover reported in the history of our company. We renewed just over 500 more residents in the third quarter of '18 versus the third quarter of '17 with roughly the same number of explorations in each period.During the third quarter, we also achieved our highest recorded resident satisfaction scores. Service related surveys completed in the third quarter, came in with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5, and year-to-date, we have increased our all-time high online reputation scores with both Google and Yahoo. Both of these are by far the most important customer review platforms to our prospects.Bottom line is that service and leasing teams have been focused on delivering remarkable experiences and their efforts are paying off. Before I move to specific market commentary, I would like to start by saying that the overall trends we discussed last quarter has continued. Our average resident tenure, currently at 2.2 years, continues to grow, as a result of our exceptional renewal process rate service and the macro trends of millennial differing life change events like marriage, children, and buying homes.For on-demand fueled by good job growth and record low levels of unemployment in our market has aided in the absorption of the elevated supply. So let's start with Boston. Full-year revenue growth expectations of 2.4% is slightly above the expectations we shared with you on our second quarter call, primarily due to strong replacement growth, which has continued into October and stronger renewal increases. This performance happened at the same time that the majority of the 2018 new supply was delivered in the urban core, and went head to head with most of our NOI. Our revised assumptions for 2018 include occupancy at 95.8%, a negative 0.8% on new lease change and achieve renewal increases of 4.9%. Deliveries will be like the urban core over the next year, which should continue to bring modest pricing power to the market.Moving to New York, our current expectation for full year revenue growth has improved to 70 basis points. This is 50 basis points higher than the expectations we shared with you on our last call. This outperformance is a large contributor to us achieving the high end of our overall company's same store revenue guidance.Our full year assumptions for New York include occupancy at 96.5%, a negative 2.2% new lease change, and achieved renewal increases of 3%. Concession used in our portfolio remains extremely targeted and is well below both last year and all expectations throughout the year.",
                 'ESS': 'Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.Michael SchallThank you, Dana. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A.I will discuss three topics on the call today: Our third quarter results and preliminary 2019 market outlook; investment market conditions; and an update on the apartment industry’s campaign to oppose California Prop 10.First topic. Our third quarter results were mostly as expected, reflecting a solid economy and severe shortages of housing on the West Coast. We continue to experience strong demand for multifamily housing across the West Coast metros with periodic disruptions to pricing when multiple apartment lease-ups occur within a submarket, often leading to large leasing concessions and often impacting pricing at nearby stabilized communities.Job growth has continued to outperform our initial 2018 expectations across the Essex portfolio. Job growth is slightly lagging in Southern California and strong in the tech market as demonstrated by greater than 3% job growth in both Seattle and San Jose. With tight labor market conditions income growth continues to outpace rent growth, which is improving rental affordability. Per capita personal income growth in Essex metros is expected to average 5.7% in 2018, up almost 1% from year-ago and compared to 4% for the nation.As John Burkart will discuss in a moment, we have experience normal seasonal patterns in 2018, which is significantly different from 2017. Same-store revenue growth for 2018 troughed in the third quarter, mostly due to revenue strategy and year-over-year seasonal variation. Overall, market conditions are much better now as compared to year-ago and our portfolio remains well-positioned.Consistent with the strong job growth reported in the tech markets, job openings for the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in California and Washington, increased 26% year-over-year to nearly 22,000 open positions as of September. With the dearth of skilled workers, employers continue to face shortages of qualified personnel, pushing wages upward to track employees from other areas.Turning to our market outlook for 2019. Today, we have a much better visibility into the year ahead, compared to last year. And thus, we have included our preliminary outlook for 2019 on page S-16 of the supplemental. We also provide the primary supply and demand drivers that shape our rent growth expectation. S-16 is intended to be a scenario based on the strength of the U.S. economy. We begin with the U.S. GDP and job growth estimate from third-party sources. And based on these key assumptions, we estimate job growth and housing demand in the Essex metros. As to housing supply, we drive each market to gain insight on apartment delivery timing to create quarterly estimates. Using historical relationships between housing supply, demand, and rent growth, we established our 2019 market rent growth expectations.For 2019, the U.S. economy is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Unemployment rate for the Essex markets declined 50 basis points than the past year, to 3.5%. Over the past several years, falling unemployment has contributed to job growth, although this positive impact will likely diminish going forward. We expect the West Coast economies to outperform the nation as to job growth, which we estimate at 1.8% for the Essex metros in 2019. This was about 30 basis points below the September actual job growth of 2.1%, again reflecting the impact of tight labor market conditions.For 2019, we expect 3.1% market rent growth in the Essex markets with California slightly outperforming Washington and the best results in San Jose and San Diego. Oakland is expected to lag due to increasing apartment deliveries. Reflecting the importance of economic growth in our 2019 assumptions, we produced a new graphic on page S-16.1 of the supplemental to demonstrate the outperformance of the Essex metros in terms of cumulative nominal GDP growth. Bottom-line, the Essex metros has outperformed the U.S. average and other major metros in the past five years and are well-positioned for continued leadership going forward.Turning to Supply in 2019. Our preliminary forecast assumes that multifamily supply will be relatively flat in 2019 versus 2018 in the Essex markets with significant variances in some markets. Most notably, we expect a substantial increase in apartment supply in Los Angeles and Oakland, and significant reductions in Orange County, San Diego and San Francisco.',
                 'EL': "Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, provisional one-time impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.Yeah. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our excellent performance continued in our fiscal third quarter, building on the momentum we generated in the first half of the year. Our strong growth was broad-based across all regions and product categories, which produced double-digit increases in both the top and the bottom lines. Sales rose 13% in constant currency, about double the robust pace of global prestige beauty, and we gained share.We leveraged our higher sales into even greater profit growth, aided by further cost savings, efficiencies and lower tax rates. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17% in constant currency. With these better-than-expected results and confidence in the fourth quarter outlook, we are again raising our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal year, which should make our performance one of our best in the last decade even in the midst of high competitive environment.Our global success came from bringing our brands into high growth markets, channels and retailers, and attracting consumers with compelling innovations, high quality products and social media activities. We have been able to devote increased investments to our digital activities as a result of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which has freed up resources from other areas. Today, all our brands are amplifying their digital communications and aligning with inspiring influencers.We have reengineered our financial structure to make this happen, and our results this quarter are proof of our ability to capitalize on positive industry trends. Our winning strategy is centered on activating and accelerating multiple engines of growth. As our business flourished around the globe, we continue to support the momentum of our fastest growing brands, countries and channels. They are gaining greater traction, as we develop more growth engines in each area.We opened new doors in consumer preferred channels and retailers, and closed less successful ones. Our results reflect skilled execution, improved analytics and our increasing agility to take advantage of opportunities quickly, effectively and respond to trends faster. Consumer interest in beauty and access to products is expanding in established and emerging markets. This trend is evident in our third quarter results, where virtually all our brands grew on a global basis.Many rose by double-digits led by our luxury tier, skin care focused brands and the Estée Lauder brand. Many of our mid-sized brands have grown so strongly in recent years that they are now leaders in their respective categories in prestige beauty. Jo Malone London for example is a top brand in high-end fragrances. La Mer is number one in luxury skin care. Tom Ford is a leader in luxury makeup and Aveda is highly ranked in natural prestige hair care. All these brands improved in the third quarter, further solidifying their positions.Sales at each of our largest brands, Estée Lauder, Clinique and M·A·C grew globally. Our established brands are winning because they are changing, innovating and appealing to new and younger consumers. The most brilliant example of this transformation is our Estée Lauder brand, and we intend to apply its playbook to other brands. Like many of our mid-sized brands, our big brands are also prestige beauty front-runners. Estée Lauder is a global leader in prestige skin care. Clinique is number one in prestige beauty in the U.S., and M·A·C is top ranked in prestige makeup worldwide.Estée Lauder was again a standout in our portfolio. Sales climbed strong double-digits, reflecting the brand's strengths across skin care and makeup, as well as in many markets and channels, illustrating it increasing global appeal. The brand's success stems from the high quality of its product customization to consumer needs by region, strong repurchase rates especially amongst its hero products, and a focus on engaging consumers through digital and social media.",
                 'EVRG': 'Lori WrightThank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy’s Third Quarter Call. Thank you for joining us this morning. Today’s discussion will include forward-looking information on Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings containing list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. We issued our third quarter 2018 earnings release and 10-Q after market close yesterday. These items are available, along with today’s webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter on the main page of our website at evergyinc.com.On the call today, we have Terry Bassham, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tony Somma, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other members of the management team are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call. As summarized on Slide 3, Terry will provide a business update, including the latest information on our regulatory and merger priorities. Tony will then offer details on our financial results and provide an update on our share repurchases.With that, I’ll hand the call to Terry.Terry BasshamThanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. I’ll start on Page 5. Last night, we reported third quarter GAAP EPS of $1.32 and pro forma EPS of $1.34, which excludes nonrecurring merger-related expenses. Tony will provide you more details in a bit, but I will say the team continues to perform well and deliver solid financial and operational results, while also executing on our integration plans. We continue to focus on the execution of the merger plan, which includes capturing merger savings, delivering on a busy regulatory calendar and rebalancing our capital structure.Last and certainly, not least, is the continued integration of our workforce and cultures. Our team is working well together as we make progress on the successful execution of our plan. We’re still targeting net merger savings of $30 million in 2018 and $110 million in 2019. Our achieved merger savings remain on track for the year. We realized savings in several categories, including reduced labor cost and more efficient procurement as we now have a scale of a larger company. We have begun back office IT system consolidation efforts, which includes a series of enterprise large projects, savings associated with combining systems will contribute toward reaching merger savings targets as they wrap up over the next couple of years.Moving on to Slide 6, I’ll give you the latest on our regulatory proceedings. At the beginning of the year, we were looking at an active regulatory calendar that included a merger docket and rate reviews in each of our 4 jurisdictions. While a formidable task our teams focus nevertheless, was to reach constructive settlements in each docket. The successful settlement in our merger docket jumpstarted many diligent and constructive conversations with stakeholders and the rate reviews. We used the merger settlement momentum to achieve rate review settlements in each jurisdiction, going 4 for 4 across Kansas and Missouri. Although we still need a commission order in one of the dockets, we are happy we’ve been able to reach settlements with most parties in these cases. This speaks to the constructive regulatory relationships that currently exist in both Kansas and Missouri.So let me give you a little detail on the rate review settlements. I’ll start with Westar. In July, we reached agreement with interveners calling for a $66 million revenue decrease with an ROE of 9.3% and an equity layer of approximately 51.5%. It also included $74 million of annual tax reform benefits for customers and $23 million merger savings benefits. In September, the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the settlement and rates became effective. Staying in Kansas and moving over to KCP&L, in mid-October, we reached a unanimous settlement that calls for an annual revenue decrease of $11 million. It also includes a 9.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 49.1%. Tax reform benefits were reflected in rates at approximately $37 million annually, along with merger benefits of about $7 million.Unanimous nature of the settlement allowed for a truncated evidence rehearing. We are now waiting on commission approval, which we expect in late December. Once the new KCPL rates become effective, the 5-year base rates payout period will start for both Westar and KCPL customers and fulfills our commitment made as part of the merger settlement agreement. Switching over to Missouri, where our rate reviews for KCPL and GMO are combined into a single docket. Similar to the Kansas cases, we reached agreement with intervenors, allowing us to file the settlement in mid-September. It’s a black box settlement, so it doesn’t outline an ROE or equity ratio. The KCPL case calls for annual revenue decrease of $21 million, including annual tax reform benefits of $53 million.',
                 'ES': "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jeffrey Kotkin from Eversource Energy. Sir, you may begin.Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource EnergyThank you, Hilda. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.Speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.Now I will turn to slide 2 and turn over the call to Phil.Philip J. Lembo - Eversource EnergyThanks, Jeff. Good morning. This morning, I'll summarize our third quarter results and recap some recent state and federal regulatory proceedings.Overall, we're very pleased with the results for the quarter and for the first nine months of the year. We've been consistent with our expectations and we continue to target full year earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.30 per share, as well as our 5% to 7% long-term earnings per share growth rate. We've also made very good progress on a number of important initiatives and continue to provide top tier reliability and service to our customers.Starting with slide number 2, we earned $0.91 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared with earnings of $0.82 per share in the third quarter last year. As noted in the earnings release, the $0.91 includes two non-recurring items. One involve the impairment of our investment in Access Northeast and the other involves some tax benefits. I'll provide more details on these impacts in a minute.Turning to our core business results, our electric distribution segment earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.50 per share in the third quarter of last year. The primary driver behind the improvement was higher distribution margin. This resulted from new rate plans in effect in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and higher sales at Public Service of New Hampshire where we're not yet decoupled.Additionally, you may recall from our second quarter results that the implementation of decoupling this year for NSTAR Electric in lieu of our former loss-based revenue mechanism resulted in higher year-over-year revenues in peak use quarters, such as the third; and lower revenues in shoulder (00:03:55) quarters, such as the second quarter. Partially offsetting the higher margin was the absence of the New Hampshire generation earnings, and higher depreciation, amortization and property tax expense, mostly at Connecticut Light and Power.Our electric transmission segment earned $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.31 in the third quarter of 2017. Improved results were due primarily to an increased level of our investment in transmission facilities this year.Our natural gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The change was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense in the gas business.Our water distribution segment, which is new this year as a result of our of last December's acquisition of Aquarion Water, earned $0.06 per share in the third quarter of this year. More than half of Aquarion's earnings are typically realized in the third quarter when customer usage is at its highest.Eversource parent and other earned $1 million in the third quarter of 2018 or less than $0.01 a share compared with earnings of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Parent and other results reflect two significant non-recurring items. First, the Access Northeast impairment of $26 million after tax or $0.08 per share represents all of our investment in the project. While we've made progress in most New England states in seeking natural gas capacity contracts with electric distribution companies, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in the summer of 2016 that the state electric utilities cannot sign such contracts without a change in law",
                 'RE': "Before we begin, please note, the Company’s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today’s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements.Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso.Dominic AddessoThank you. Good morning. Last night, we released earnings per share of $5.02 for the third quarter. Despite the number of catastrophes for the industry in the quarter, this turned out to be a quarter for us with a solid ROE. This result reflects a strong quarter for investment income, continued strong underwriting income from attritional results and tax benefits achieved from our portfolio of composition.These factors, coupled with a positive equity market resulting in realized gains for the quarter, produced 9.7% annualized net income ROE for the quarter. No doubt that it has been an active last 15 months for cat losses, and of course, one more quarter to go with already some known cats.Well it's been challenging for those individuals and businesses directly impacted by these events. These are challenges to which we have responded well and in fact better than most. Over that time, we continued to produce positive results and we anticipate the same in the fourth quarter.Our portfolio composition is able to absorb volatility and over the longer-term, including these recent years, has produced total shareholder return of over 12%. On an ROE basis, over the last five years, Everest has outperformed by approximately 300 basis points, a top 20 peers listing as compiled by A. M. Best.Nevertheless, we must always look forward. And as all of us recognized, there are significant questions which persist around our industry, most notably, the influx of third-party capital and price adequacy. That is why you may have observed that over time, our net annual expected cat load has drifted down from over 12 combined ratio points to currently less than 9, and will likely drift down into next year.This has been and will continue to be the result of deliberate execution of our strategy, a combination of reducing and diversifying our cat portfolio and diversifying into other segments of the business. You will hear more about this from my colleagues. We continue to believe the future is bright for Everest given the scale we have on the business and our breadth of underwriting and capital management capabilities.And therefore the ability to leverage that into the better opportunities, the market offers and to participate meaningfully in new classes and constructs. We see the recent catastrophe events as being a strong proof point of our value proposition and this along with our clients focus on earnings volatility, has continuing to increase demand for our products and services. Thank you for your participation this morning, and I look forward to our dialogue during the Q&A.I'll now turn it over to Craig for detailed financial results.Craig HowieThank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had net income of $206 million for the third quarter of 2018. This compares to a net loss of $639 million for the third quarter last year, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $486 million compared to a net loss of $102 million for the first nine months of 2017.Net income year-to-date included $35 million of net after tax realized capital gains compared to $79 million of capital gains in the first nine months of 2017. The capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the third quarter was $167 million compared to a loss of $624 million in 2017.Operating income year-to-date was $428 million compared to a loss of $123 million for the first nine months of 2017. The group recorded a modest underwriting gain of $278,000 for the third quarter essentially a breakeven result with a 100% combined ratio. This compared to an underwriting loss of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 with the combined ratio of 164%.The year-to-date underwriting gain for the group was $21 million compared to an underwriting loss $705 million for the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio was 99.6% compared to 116.5% reported for the first nine months of 2017 reflecting the higher catastrophe losses in 2017.These results reflect the series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures for both 2017 and 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, the group saw $240 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017.",
                 'EXC': "At this time, I'd like turn the show over to Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. The floor is yours. Daniel EggersThank you, Jerome.

We scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.Chris CraneThanks, Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. Flipping to slide five, we delivered another strong quarter with earnings again at the upper-end of our range, which allows us to raise the lower end of our full year guidance. The utilities performed well with strong earned ROEs and largely first quartile operations. As we stated previously, the Federal Courts of Appeal in Illinois and New York strongly affirm the legality of the ZEC.And our focus on cost continues identifying an additional $200 million in gross savings, which are $150 million of that will flow to the bottom line, bringing our six-year total savings to more than $900 million. Combined, this performance demonstrates our growing value.For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we are at $0.76 per share versus $0.85 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we are at $0.80 per share, and again above the midpoint of our $0.80 to $0.90 range guidance that was provided.Turning to slide six, our utilities continue to perform at higher levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making in technology and infrastructure continue to improve reliability, which leads to greater customer satisfaction, and ultimately supporting strong relations with our regulators and our legislators.PECO and BG improved their JV power residential gas and electric scores over the last year with PECO receiving its highest ranking ever, placing second in the residential electric survey. Our customer service metrics is strong. BGE and ComEd are in the top decile for customer satisfaction, and PHI is in top decile for its service levels.Each of our utilities achieved top quartile reliability performance in SAIFI, or outage duration in CAIDI, which is -- the outage frequency is SAIFI, and CAIDI which is outage duration. ComEd and PHI performed in top decile for CAIDI. SAIFI as we've discussed in the past is our highest priority and remains that our metrics have continued to improve since the beginning of the year.At ExGen, in our third quarter was -- excuse me, 39.7 terawatt hours of capacity factor at 93.6%. During the fourth hottest summer in nearly 125 years, we performed at 96.7% capacity factor, and avoided 33 metric tons of carbon. Our gas and hydro fleet performed well, but below plan with economic dispatch match at 95.8%. This lower performance was primarily the result of our CCG's account Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow being offline because of some turbine blades defects. The blades have been replaced. Wolf Hollow came back into service in late September. One of the Colorado Bend units returned to service in October, and the other will be back in service shortly. It's in the process of restart as we speak. We took advantage of the outage time performing normal maintenance that would have been required to have that shut down for next spring.From a financial perspective, all repairs were covered under a warranty, and the markets impact from the plants being down are well within our full range outage contingency plan. The plants ran very well over the summer prior to the outages, and we're very pleased with the performance of the design and their durability. They remain an integral part of our Texas strategy.",

We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate, we are optimistic that, or similar statements. Please refer to today's earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You will find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's investor relations website at ir.expediagroup.com, and I encourage you to periodically visit our IR website for other important content including today's earnings release.Unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. And all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.Finally, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not provided because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable efforts. These items include but are not limited to foreign exchange, returns on investment spending and acquisition-related or restructuring expenses. As such, the items that are excluded from our non-GAAP guidance are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP results for the guidance period.And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark.Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia Group, Inc.Thanks, Michael. We continued to build on our operational and financial momentum in the third quarter, posting strong top and bottom line results. At the same time, our organization is focused on executing several key initiatives that underpin the three strategic themes I shared this time a year ago: being locally relevant on a global basis; being more customer-centered; and speeding up the pace of execution and innovation. While we are still in the early days of this journey, I'm pleased with our progress to date. We're collaborating across the company more than ever, and the organization is aligned around clear objectives, squarely aimed at unlocking the full potential of our global travel platform. As we continue to push forward on these strategic priorities, we're optimistic that they will result in sustained growth and share gains in this massive travel market for a long time to come.In the third quarter, we grew gross bookings 11% and revenue 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased a very strong 29%. Our brands are making nice strides, optimizing direct marketing spend, balancing quality topline growth with profitability. That approach was evident in both our strong adjusted EBITDA growth and solid 13% increase in total lodging stayed room nights. We continued to see very good execution on our supply acquisition efforts. We added 40,000 properties to our core global lodging platform in the third quarter, bringing our total property count to approximately 595,000, excluding HomeAway, a 46% increase compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have now acquired over 150,000 properties and remain on pace to directly acquire at least 180,000 new properties for the full year. We also integrated 100,000 additional HomeAway listings onto our global lodging platform for the quarter and now count over 895,000 total properties in our core lodging portfolio.Our concerted efforts to push into our priority markets continued to show promise. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress. We continue to add properties and work through everything it takes to be locally relevant in these markets. In addition to adding properties, our teams are laser focused on refining our product by enhancing areas like language translation and localized content, all aimed at making sure we provide a great experience for customers in each and every market.As a reminder, this year's just the beginning of our new operating model calling for a much more focused approach to global expansion. We expect this new approach to drive better performance in the coming years as we improve our supply position and product in these initial markets and extend this strategy to other key geographies in 2019 and beyond.",
                 'EXR': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Norman. Sir, you may begin.Jeff NormanThank you, Lisa. Welcome to Extra Space Storage’s third quarter 2018 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our Web site. Please remember that management’s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statement due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business.These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company’s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of today, Wednesday, October 31, 2018. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.Joe MargolisThank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter call and for your interest Extra Space Storage. 2018 is playing out as we expected as we move into the last couple of months of the year. Revenue, NOI and FFO growth are all start remained within guidance and expectations. Occupancy continues to be strong ending the quarter at 93.9%, 20 basis points above 2017’s mark. This is especially encouraging, because last year’s quarter end occupancy benefited from the hurricanes.We continue to have solid rate growth, which was partially offset by increased but expected discounts, resulting in same-store revenue growth of 3.2%. The year-over-year impact from discounts should taper off in the fourth quarter. And we project higher same-store revenue growth.External growth was also strong in the quarter. We continue to be selective and disciplined in our acquisition efforts, but have been able to find acquisitions with acceptable risk adjusted returns, primarily through existing relationships. By year end, we expect to have acquired over $1 billion in properties with Extra Space investing approximately $600 million. Between acquisitions and third-party management contracts, we have added 140 stores through the quarter. We have more than 500 third-party properties and a total of 734 stores, including joint ventures.Our report related to new supply remains generally unchanged. We are seeing an impact from new supply in certain sub-markets, and its impact varies by location. New stars appear to be down in many MSAs already saturated with new development and activity is migrating to markets where there may be a better yield. We continue to see delays in deliveries and see many proposed projects being abandoned. Our highly diversified portfolio, while certainly not immune to the effects of new supply, reduces volatility. And our sophisticated platform is better prepared to respond to competition than ever before.At this time last year, we were reporting the impact hurricanes had on our customers, our employees and our properties. Unfortunately, the Southeast experienced severe weather again, but I am happy to report that our portfolio was relatively unscathed. We did not have any material disruption with customers or employees, and damage to our properties was minimal.I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. Scott Stubbs Thanks, Joe, and happy Halloween, everyone. Last night, we reported core FFO for the quarter of $1.20 per share. Rental rates to new customers continue to be solid. Throughout the quarter, our achieve rental rate was up approximately 3% to 4% year-over-year. As expected and as discussed on our last call, discounts as a percentage of revenue were also up, partially offsetting revenue growth.As Joe mentioned, we anticipate the impact from discounts to decrease in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increase in same-store revenue growth. We saw expense growth normalize in the third quarter, and we were successful in minimizing increases in our controllable expenses. Property taxes, while elevated, were in line with our expectations. The increase in insurance premiums was not a surprise due to the elevated level of property claims caused by last year's hurricane.We also chose to invest more in marketing in the quarter, allowing us to grow rates and keep our stores full heading into the fall and winter. We continue to execute our leverage neutral balance sheet strategy. During the quarter, we increased the percentage of unsecured debt and the size of our unencumbered pool and further laddered our maturities. We're also in the process of increasing and extending our credit facility. In the quarter, we sold $34 million on or ATM at an average price for $99.75 per share. We also disposed off one property in California for $40.7 million. The property was sold at a below market cap rate for an alternative use and we anticipate the reinvested proceeds will produce a significantly higher yield.",
                 'XOM': "Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir.Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.As we'll discuss on the call today, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. It was a quarter highlighted by strong operating performance, significant growth in liquids production, and considerable value from our integrated business model. As a result, we delivered the highest level of cash flow from operating activities since 2014.In addition, we completed several advantaged projects and made significant progress on investments that will generate long-term accretive value for our shareholders.After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Jack will provide his perspectives on third quarter results and give an update on several key investments and strategic focus areas. Jack and I will be happy to take your questions following our prepared remarks.Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation.I'll move now to slide 3, which summarizes a number of developments that influenced our third quarter performance. As I mentioned previously, cash flow from operating activities was the highest it's been in four years, dating back to the third quarter of 2014.Corporate charges for the quarter were outside the $700 million to $900 million range that we typically experience. This was due to net favorable absolute one-time items of $420 million, primarily related to tax. Now it's important to note that we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be at the high end of the normal range of $700 million to $900 million.Crude oil prices increased slightly during the quarter, with Brent up $0.92 and WTI up $1.71. Permian tight oil production increased by 17% relative to the second quarter. We continue to ramp up drilling activities in the Permian, while also maximizing the value from our integrated midstream and manufacturing operations.We had lower levels of downtime in the third quarter and stronger operating performance in Canada, where Kearl delivered quarterly record net production of 230,000 barrels per day.We also achieved a number of significant milestones on long-term Upstream growth plans in Guyana and Brazil. Jack will discuss this a bit later in the call.In the Downstream, tighter supply resulted in stronger fuels margins in Europe, while wider crude differentials contributed to improved margins in North America. We successfully leveraged our midstream logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities.Improved utilization from lower scheduled maintenance and better reliability also contributed to stronger earnings in the quarter.In line with our strategy to grow sales of higher-value products, we successfully started up a new hydrofiner at our Beaumont, Texas, facility and a delayed coker at our Antwerp refinery. The hydrofiner will increase production of ultra-low sulfur fuels by 45,000 barrels per day, using a proprietary catalyst that will remove sulfur, while minimizing octane loss. The Antwerp delayed coker will increase supply of distillates and marine gas oil, further strengthening our Downstream portfolio ahead of IMO 2020.The long-term demand fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business. We experienced weaker margins during the quarter. Improved realizations were more than offset by higher feedstock costs, primarily U.S. ethane. A significant scheduled turnaround at our Singapore facility also impacted quarterly results.We continue to expand Chemical manufacturing on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This included start-up of the 1.5 million metric ton per year ethane cracker at our Baytown, Texas, chemical and refining complex.Now moving to slide 4, which provides an overview of third quarter financial results. Third quarter earnings were $6.2 billion or $1.46 per share, up 57% from the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.6 billion, including a $1.5 billion in proceeds from asset sales.Third quarter CapEx was $6.6 billion. We continue to progress investment to support our long-term growth plans, including increased activity in the Permian and the acquisition of additional acreage in Brazil.CapEx through the first three quarters of the year was $18.1 billion. Now if you exclude the acquisition of incremental Brazil acreage of about $1 billion, we remain on pace to meet full-year guidance of approximately $24 billion.Free cash flow after investments was $7.2 billion, more than enough to cover the $3.5 billion in dividends.Debt ended the quarter at $40 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease compared to the second quarter. And as a result, we've reached the lowest level of debt that we've had since the end of 2015.Cash increased to $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter. This increase, which was above our normal operating levels, due primarily to the timing of proceeds from the Germany retail divestment, which closed in the fourth quarter. So again, we received those proceeds the day before the quarter ended, and the transaction closed on October 1. We don't have the earnings impact in this quarter, but we did receive the cash.I'll start the more detailed review of our third quarter results with a reconciliation of Upstream financial and operating performance. Slide 5 provides a look at Upstream results relative to the second quarter.Liquids growth contributed to Upstream earnings of $4.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase. Gas prices increased by 7%. Crude realizations were essentially flat, impacted by wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials. However – and we look at this – the estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on our Upstream was $170 million, but given our integrated logistics and manufacturing position, that value and more was captured in the Downstream.Having the takeaway capacity that we have that exceeds our Upstream production allows us to – allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit of approximately $280 million in the Downstream.Lower scheduled downtime and the absence of impacts from the PNG earthquake increased Upstream earnings by $130 million. An increase in production, in addition to the volume recovery we saw from lower downtime, contributed $320 million to third quarter earnings. Other items included net absolute favorable one-time tax impacts of $370 million.",
                 'FFIV': "I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dennis Melton, Interim Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Dennis Melton - F5 Networks, Inc.Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. As the operator said, I am Dennis Melton, F5's Interim Lead of Investor Relations.

These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized on our quarterly release and described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.I will now turn the call over to Frank.Francis J. Pelzer - F5 Networks, Inc.Thank you, Dennis. My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continued to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit.Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million. GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 per share to $1.82 per share. This beat was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share.In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year. Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue.On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of total revenue, grew 4% from a year ago.Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.In Q3, we had five greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue; SYNNEX Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11%. And Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.I will now discuss our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%, in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%.Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter.Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by our build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high-maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock and an average price of $166.22 per share, for a total of $150 million.",
                 'FB': "Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc.Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Facebook's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.Thanks, Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a solid quarter, and our community and business continue to grow quickly. 2.3 billion people now use Facebook every month, and 1.5 billion every day. Revenue grew 33% year over year to $13.7 billion.Last quarter, for the first time, we also shared the number of people who use at least one of our apps each month. We believe this is a better way to measure our community over time because so many people use more than one of our apps. There are now more than 2.6 billion people using Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger each month, up from around 2.5 billion last quarter. But now, on average, more than 2 billion people use at least one of our services every day.Today, I want to talk about our strategy overall as we navigate challenges and opportunities on several fronts. For one, we're seeing the way people connect shifting to private messaging and stories. We have great products here that people love, but it will take some time for our business to catch up to our community growth.Two, we're seeing video grow dramatically across the ecosystem. And while Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience. Three, we continue to face increased safety and security threats. We've significantly improved our systems here, but we have more to do.So let's start with messaging and stories. Public sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with stories. People feel more comfortable being themselves when they know their content will only be seen by a smaller group and when their content won't stick around forever. Messaging and stories make up the vast majority of growth in the sharing that we're seeing.On messaging specifically, we think we've built the best messaging apps in the world. People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher daily message volume than SMS had globally at its peak. And this isn't just text. People share more photos, videos and links on WhatsApp and Messenger than they do on social networks.We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is iMessage. And in important countries like the U.S., where the iPhone is strong, Apple bundled iMessage as a default texting app and it's still ahead. In countries where there's more competition between iOS and Android, like much of Europe, people tend to prefer our services.Now, it's worth noting that one of the main reasons people prefer our services, especially WhatsApp, is because of its stronger record on privacy. WhatsApp is completely end-to-end encrypted, does not store your messages and doesn't store the keys to your messages in China or anywhere else. And this is important because if our systems can't see your messages, then that means that governments and bad actors won't be able to access them through us either.Our roadmap focuses on continuing to make WhatsApp and Messenger even simpler, faster and adding basic utility features like payments. We found that every time we make our services faster and simpler, people communicate more. We'll also keep pushing our messaging services to be more private and secure, and we believe this will continue to be a competitive advantage for us.On the business side of messaging, our first step has been to enable people to connect with businesses organically in ways they find useful, and then the second step is to give businesses additional paid tools to increase those interactions. We're well into step one at this point, with more than 3 million accounts on WhatsApp Business. We'll begin step two with a couple of products, paid messaging and ads in Stories.",
                 'FAST': 'Ellen StoltsWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company’s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.Dan FlornessGood morning, everybody and thank you for joining the third quarter earnings conference call for Fastenal Company. I will start the discussion with – before I get to the flipbook, just recap a few things going on in our business and to add some transparency to some things that are going on in the business, had a call early this morning with our regional leadership and around the planet. Holden ran through a bunch of the financial aspects and discussed the release in general, talked about some of the points that we will be focusing on in the earnings call today to have that group be really well-informed of what’s happening in the business and that’s something we do every quarter.I started my comments with a simple message to the group. September was a big month. Coming into the month, we had an aggressive goal. And January caused us to just miss our internal sales goal earlier in the year. Since then we have been in excess of goal every month, very similar to what we experienced in 2017 from the standpoint of good solid top line growth hitting our internal goals, which gives us the confidence to invest in the business. Year-to-date, we are at 100.7% of goal. When I looked at the numbers on last Saturday, a week ago Saturday, we were at 99.9%, not all the numbers were in yet. So I thought okay, we have a good shot of hitting goal. We came in at 100.0% of goal in September. Proud of what we accomplished as an organization from the standpoint of establishing the goal and going out and getting it.In the last 2 days, we had our typical board meetings and the evening before our board meeting is typically a session where we introduce a topic that we delve deeper into. In past quarters, we have talked about some of the acquisitions we have done, we have talked about some business development opportunities, we will talk specifically about our Onsite business, our vending business, our e-commerce business, our construction business, just to shed additional insight for our Board of Directors for their own knowledge and engagement as a Director of our organization, but also to solicit input from a very talented group. Our meeting on Monday evening, I typically don’t cover that session, I covered that session and talked a bit about the company and I just want to share some of the things we talked about.As we did at last year’s annual meeting, we talk about Fastenal, what we looked like when we were a $2 billion company, which was roughly 11 years ago in 2007. We talked a bit at that time about what we will look like as a $4 billion company. And this year as we prepare for our internal discussions in December and our annual meeting next year, we will get to talk about Fastenal as a $5 billion company and we’ll talk about how we have morphed, how we have evolved over the last 10, 11 years.We also had a pretty lengthy discussion about what we look like when we are a $10 billion company. And we focused on four aspects of the business. One was the products we sell. If you look at it fasteners and now safety products combined make up roughly half of our business. Fasteners made up half our business a decade ago, but as the other businesses have grown, especially safety has grown, it’s morphed a little bit. We talked about our selling channels, our branch, our Onsite integrated supply, a relatively small business that’s kind of tucked away into the Onsite business. And our channel extender in everything that we do, a little thing called vending and in-stock. We talked about the definition of our customer, who it was 10 years ago, who it is today, who do we believe it’s going to be 10 years – excuse me when we are a $10 billion company, and there we talked about the manufacturing customer, little bit of some of the subsets, the construction customer, a government customer and all the others.',
                 'FRT': " I’d now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Leah Brady. Please go ahead ma’am.Leah BradyGood morning, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.I’d like to remind everyone that certain matters on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results.Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty’s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website. [Operator Instructions]And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don?Don WoodThank you, Leah. Good morning, everybody. At a $1.58 a share in the third quarter, we generated more funds from operations in a 90-day period than we ever have in our 56-year history. On an absolute basis, this was simply the best quarter we’ve ever had. More than 5% ahead of last year’s quarter, and in excess of both the streets and our internal expectations contributions came from all parts of our business and on both coasts. Overall rental income grew 5.5% quarter-over-quarter. Earnings growth at comparable properties was particularly strong at 3.5%. The comparable portfolio remains 95% leased and 94% occupied and operating expenses including G&A, but not including real estate taxes, actually fell slightly quarter-over-quarter despite 12 million more in revenue, real estate taxes it seems never goes down. The only metric that was underwhelming for us on the surface was comparable retail lease rollover growth at 6%, 90-day comp, 90 comparable deals were 448,000 square feet and an average rent of 38.31 per foot, 6% above the 36.22 that the previous tenant was paying in the last year of the lease. Not bad, but it’s not what you’re used to seeing. So let’s take a deeper look and breaking down the overall results space leased to new tenants grew at 13% with the previous tenant, while renewals of existing tenants grew at only 2%. That’s the combined 6% rollover. The detail supporting this 2% renewal rollover rates revealed that more than half of the renewal rent came from just two deals, both of whom renewed flat for the last year their previously lease and therefore depressed the reported percentage increase. A strong credit anchor at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California and the Best Buy building at Santana Row.Now many of you who are familiar with our portfolio know both of those properties well. So let me spend a minute on the transactions behind the summarized metrics to hopefully help interpret what they mean. So consider this, rent in the East Bay Bridge anchor lease has been increasing annually at 3% since its inception in 1995 through 2009 and 3.5% annually since 2009. I don’t know of any big anchor deals that have those kind of embedded annual bumps in them. Most for flat for five or 10 years and then bump 10% or so. Run the math, those are very different economics. So we decided to renew it flat to the grown prior year rent and from here it will continue to grow 3.5% annually for the option period and by the way no tenant improvement dollars from us. Given more typical anchor lease tenants, this new rent would equate to a huge bump over the old rent, and our rollover statistics would have reflected double-digit growth yet we’d be far off economic, the far worse off economically. The strengthen location the lease terms from the very strong productivity of the store allowed us to get paid millions more in rent along the way, deal terms matter.Next, rent paid by the anchor at the hard corner of Steven's Creek Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row more than paid for construction of the building they occupy by the time the initial terminal lease expired in 2014 and with the exercise of their first option back then has paid to the building more than twice over. The exercise of their second five year option came in this quarter at the same rent despite significant supply coming on line at Valley Fair across the street and again no TI dollars paid by us. The real estate economics here are incredibly compelling despite negatively impacting the rollover metric. I go through those two leases at the pick of it, because digging behind any in all of the reported metrics is increasingly important as all of our businesses get more complicated and harder to compare. But at the end of the day, it comes down to FFO per share growth. We’re particularly proud of the consistency and sustainability of that earnings growth year-in and year-out, no excuses. It’s widely worked as hard as we have to diversify our revenue streams and why are we using our existing real estate platforms to create a real estate value for redevelopment and intensification on both coasts. The focal point is exploitation of our superior locations and cash flow streams through the lens of a broad real estate perspective. And this isn’t just about our big mix use projects, because it applies with our core shopping centers too. For example, you’ll see that we’ve added to our 8K redevelopment schedule this quarter a $23 million, 87 unit residential project at Bala Cynwyd shopping center on Cityline Avenue just outside of Philadelphia. This will be our seventh residential project developed internally by our team to intensify one of our core shopping centers. The other is being two with Congressional Plaza, Winwood Shopping Center, Chelsea Comments and London Square with more on the horizon.",

Welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings first and most importantly by far we are very thankful that with no serious injuries from the package that was detonated earlier with our San Antonio, FedEx Ground Facility. FedEx has provided law enforcement extensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems, design to protect the safety of our team mates, our customers and the communities we serve. We continue to do assist authorities.Now moving to the businesses hand and specifically turning to the earnings, execution of long-term growth strategies, customer demand for the unique value of our broad portfolio of solutions and healthy growth in the global economy are driving our performance. We expect strong operating performance in that regard during the fourth quarter in each of our transportation segments and remain confident. We will improve the operating income at the Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.We remain committed and optimistic about growing earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. Economic growth around the world remained broadly based and we expect U.S tax reform to continue to increase economic growth and investment. FedEx is concerned about the prospect of increased protectionist tariffs as history is shown repeatedly that protectionism is counterproductive to economic growth. The better approach is to encourage open markets and free exchange of products and services and to reduce barriers to trade.Congratulations to our team members around the world for another outstanding peak season, with record volumes and high service level. TNT integration efforts are accelerating and we are well positioned for profitable long-term growth due to investments in our network and people such as our recent commitment to $3.2 billion in wage increases, bonuses, pension funding and expanded U.S capital investment. FedEx is proud to be in the top 10 companies in Fortune magazine's world most admired lives and among its best companies to work for. We believe this reflects our team members' dedication through our purple promise, which states simply, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.Now let me turn the call over to my colleagues for their insight, first up Alan Graf. Alan?Alan GrafThank you, Fred. We included additional information in today's earnings release and I will provide additional detail during my discussion today about our third quarter due to unusually complex operating results and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. We will also provide additional details today regarding our expected fourth quarter financial performance, given the complexities of the TCJA and third quarter results in order to help you understand the underlying performance of our businesses.",
                 'FIS': "I'd now like to turn the conference over to our first speaker, Pete Gunnlaugsson.

This conference call is also being webcast with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.Moving to slide 3, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law. I refer you to the safe harbor language on the slide. The materials presented today will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide a more meaningful comparison between the periods presented. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the Appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.Turning to slide 4, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights for the third quarter. Gary?Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to announce that FIS delivered strong results again this quarter, delivering 4% organic growth. Our sales pipeline and revenue backlog are strong and continue to grow. These are positive signals that our clients are continuing to invest for the future.Growth in the quarter was driven by strong sales over the prior three quarters as well as exceptional operational execution. The continued expansion of existing client relationships, growth of our clients through higher volumes of transactions and accounts and new client logos builds on our positive momentum as we near the end of the year. We continue to be pleased by the accelerating market momentum globally for our mission-critical products and services.Turning to slide 5 for key themes, in the year, we continued to make strong progress executing against our modernization and market expansion strategies, which we have shared throughout the year. Our focused investment in our enterprise DIGITAL ONE platform brings modern, best-in-class capabilities to both self-service channels such as mobile, lab and tablet to banker-assisted channels like branch systems, teller, kiosk, call center and back office.Its new architecture and design provides a clear path to a modern banking experience for financial institutions around the world and allows us to expand our reach into new markets. DIGITAL ONE has already had early success throughout 2018 in the large regional and direct bank market in the U.S. We are excited about this solution making an even broader impact to financial institutions and credit unions for the remainder of the year and throughout 2019. Similarly, our investments into more modern payment loyalty solutions are seeing strong demand with solid end quarter results. These solutions are also opening new markets globally to FIS.Additionally, through our modernization focus, we continue to successfully execute on our data center consolidation strategy and expect to run more than 50% of our production workloads in our private cloud by year-end. This data center strategy is not only driving higher availability for our clients, but we're also seeing the significant cost savings flow through our results, in line with our projections during our May investor update. Based on these comprehensive modernization programs along with other initiatives, we will continue to drive long-term scalability, growth and resiliency for FIS. As a result, we are confident that we will exit 2018 with a solid foundation that positions us well for success in 2019 and beyond.Turning to our segments, Integrated Financial Solutions drove another strong quarter of organic growth and margin expansion. Exceeding our expectations, these results were underpinned by increased transaction and processing volumes and as mentioned robust year-to-date sales. Demand for our retail banking, digital, wealth and payments businesses remained strong in the quarter as our clients continued to seek more efficient and modern ways to run their operations, grow their businesses and connect with their customers across digital channels.I'd like to share a few client highlights across our broad financial services portfolio. In a competitive core takeaway deal, a fast-growing Texas-based community bank chose FIS as its core banking platform to support its strategy to outpace its competitors, while growing and expanding into new markets. This multi-year deal also includes a full suite of ancillary solutions including debit and image processing, fraud and new digital banking and payments capabilities, providing the bank with advanced operating efficiencies and a more modern user experience for its customers.",
                 'FITB': 'Mr. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.Sameer GokhaleThank you Kyle. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today we will be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Please review the forward-looking cautionary statement in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release presentation and other materials. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.Part of our discussion includes commentary surrounding the proposed merger of MB Financial Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp. Please also review the cautionary language contained in our earnings release and related presentations concerning important additional information regarding this merger and where to find it.Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today’s conference call are included in our earnings release and related presentation, along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. This morning, I’m joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer Frank Forrest, and Treasurer Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.Greg CarmichaelThanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $418 million and earnings of $0.61 per share. Included in these results are two items which had a negative impact of $0.03 on reported EPS. Excluding these items, core earnings were $0.64 per share in the third quarter.Our financial results for the quarter were strong and reflected our focus on generating profitable growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and maintaining our expense discipline. I am pleased that we are continuing to realize the benefits of several initiatives we implemented under Project North Star. Before I revisit our key strategic priorities and highlights for the quarter, I’d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. The economic backdrop remains generally strong. Consumers are benefiting from a strong labor market with the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years and healthy wage growth. These factors have helped drive increased consumer spending and positive consumer sentiment; in fact, consumer confidence among lower income Americans is at the highest level since 2000.In our core commercial business, our clients continue to see the benefits of lower taxes and deregulation, but the imposition of tariffs and escalating rhetoric with China has created uncertainty for our commercial customers. We are optimistic that the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada will help alleviate some of this geopolitical uncertainty. In addition to the developments in international trade, we are closely monitoring corporate debt levels. Higher leverage borrowers outside the traditional banking sector may experience difficulties as the Fed continues to raise interest rates. These issues could have a spillover effect that may negatively impact economic growth. While the overall economic backdrop remains supportive of future growth, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious. We will continue to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability.Moving on to our strategic priorities, at Fifth Third we are focused on three key priorities. They are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as achieve expense efficiencies. Executing on these initiatives will enable us to achieve our financial and strategic objectives as we have previously communicated.First, we are focused on completing the implementation of our remaining North Star initiatives. We announced North Star in late 2016 along with the financial targets that we expect to achieve after completing the program. As we have said previously, the vast majority of the projects will be completed by the end of this year with results fully realized by year-end 2019. There are a few areas of work remaining to be completed this year but we are very pleased with our overall progress. We believe that our strong results again this quarter indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives under Project North Star.Our next party is to successfully complete the MB Financial transaction. With the North Star implementation work behind us in 2018, we can focus on ensuring that the integration of MB proceeds smoothly. We remain confident in our ability to realize the expected expense and revenue synergies which we have previously communicated.',
                 'FE': "Irene PrezeljThanks, Melissa. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies and prospects.These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on the investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings.We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation, which supports today's discussion.Participants in today's call include Chuck Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Strah, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and several other executives in the room, who are available to participate in the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Chuck.Charles JonesThank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. We had a great quarter, and I'm pleased to have this chance to speak with you about our results and our progress on key initiatives. Since our last call in August, we have successfully carried out several of the critical steps necessary to complete our transition to a fully regulated utility.As I'm sure you know, on September 25, the bankruptcy court approved our definitive settlement agreement in the Chapter 11 proceedings of FirstEnergy Solutions, its subsidiaries and FENOC. This very positive development marks perhaps the most important milestone in our exit from competitive generation. While you may occasionally see news about the progress of FES, FENOC and their affiliates, as they work with the bankruptcy court. To be clear, we expect that none of this will impact our ability to execute our regulated strategy.We're also in the final stages of implementing our FE Tomorrow initiative, which will align our cost structure and shared services workforce to efficiently and effectively support our regulated businesses going forward. In total, 960 positions in our shared service organization were impacted by this effort. In addition to the nearly 500 employees, who accepted our voluntary enhanced retirement package, we eliminated nearly 230 open positions, transition some employees into opportunities in our utility business and created a flatter, leaner management structure by reducing layers and increasing spans of control.As part of this streamlining effort, there are nearly 45% fewer leadership positions in our shared services organization, including 46 Director, Executive Director and Vice President positions and 163 supervisory and manager level positions. The majority of these organizational changes went into effect during the third quarter.As part of the FE Tomorrow effort, our teams identified opportunities that will eliminate the $300 million of cost that were associated with our competitive operations. In addition, we expect to fully offset the $30 million of depreciation, associated with common systems shared with FES. We also identified an additional $20 million of O&M and interest, and $35 million in capital reductions for total incremental cash savings of $85 million. The expected savings include reductions in labor costs and less reliance on contractor work and will be reflected in the 2019 earnings guidance, we will provide at EEI next month.The FE Tomorrow initiative has been an outstanding effort by our teams across our corporate functions. In fact, a level of projected operating expenses associated with our shared services organization, benchmark solely within the top quartile of our industry. And we are confident that we have the proper organization and cost structure to support our fully regulated business. Past two years and this year, in particular, have been a period of rapid change in our company. I'm extremely proud of our employees' ability to remain focused on the execution of our objectives.As you saw in the results we posted last night, our regulated businesses continue to perform very well. We reported strong third quarter results and exceeded our guidance, largely due to the hot summer weather that is lingered through the end of September. We will discuss our earnings drivers in more detail, but we were very pleased that in addition to the benefits from the heat, we saw a second consecutive quarter of growth in residential weather adjusted usage.And at the same time, industrial usage was up 2.5% compared to the third quarter of 2017, marking the ninth quarter of growth in that class. On the regulatory front, we continue to execute on our plans. In August, we filed the first base rate case for Potomac Edison in Maryland in nearly 25 years. And this week, we supplemented the filing to update the partially forecasted test year with the full 12 months of actual data.The $19.7 million request addresses recovery of the investments we have made in our Maryland distribution system to ensure continued, safe and reliable service. The request is net of $7.3 million in customer savings related to federal tax reform. The Maryland Public Service Commission provided a procedural schedule that includes evidentiary hearings beginning on January 22, we expect a final order by March 23. In Ohio, our application for our $450 million distribution platform modernization plan is pending at the PUCO.",
                 'FRC': "Shannon HoustonThank you, and welcome to First Republic Bank's third quarter 2018 conference call. Speaking today will be Jim Herbert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gaye Erkan, President; and Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer.Before I hand the call over to Jim, please note that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, please see the bank's FDIC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, all available on the bank's Web site.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Herbert.Jim HerbertThank you, Shannon. It was another very good quarter for the bank by virtually every measure. First Republic's ability to deliver truly differentiated client service is continuing to result in safe, strong organic growth as well as very robust new household acquisition.Let me touch on a few of the highlights for the quarter. Year-over-year through the quarter, total loans have grown 21.6%. Total deposits have grown 14.2%, and wealth management assets have grown 29.2%. This growth across the entire franchise continues to lead to very good overall financial performance.For the quarter ended year-over-year, total revenue grew 15%. Importantly, net interest income grew 15% and tangible book value per share has increased 13%. Very strong credit quality has always been and continues to be a color of First Republic.Our nonperforming assets were less than 5 basis points at quarter end. Net charge-offs for the quarter were only $185,000, less than a single basis point of average loans. As we get further into this economic cycle, strong credit quality will become an even more important -- will become even more important and will be a key differentiator for First Republic.Let me reflect on this for just an extra moment. Over the past five years, First Republic's cumulative net charge-offs have totaled only $8 million. Over the same period, we have added to our bad debt reserves fully $278 million. This is a 35x coverage in the reserve addition. Our capital levels also remain quite strong. This is consistent with our historical philosophy of staying well capitalized at every point in the economic cycle.Let me turn for a moment to the condition of our markets. Our urban, coastal mortgage markets overall remain quite strong actually. San Francisco, Southern California, and Boston, all continue to perform quite well. As we noted last quarter, although New York is performing very well, its real estate market has moderated somewhat, particularly in the high-end of the luxury home market, which we don't have much business in, but certainly ripples and in commercial real estate.Let me shift briefly to our millennial strategy. We continue to be quite pleased with the progress we're making in attracting our next generation of clients through the student loan refinance and professional loan programs. The number of millennial households acquired through these programs in the first nine months of this year is 60% higher than the same period last year. Such millennial households have an average age of 33 years at the time of acquisition.These younger households now represent over 28% of First Republic's borrowing households. Needless to say, we’re quite pleased with this progress. In short, it was a very successful third quarter and 2018 thus far.Now let me turn the call over to Gaye Erkan, President.Gaye ErkanThank you, Jim. As Jim mentioned, it was a very good quarter. Loan origination volume during the quarter was strong at $7 billion. Single-family residential volume was $2.6 billion during the quarter. Although this was down slightly from a year-ago, we are quite pleased that new purchase volume remains strong and now represents 55% of total volume.Single-family refinance was down of course due to rising rates. Importantly, a shift towards the purchase market gives us a competitive advantage by allowing us to demonstrate our differentiated client service. Multifamily and commercial real estate lending also had a good quarter. This combined, originations up slightly from last year.Importantly, our weighted average loan to value ratios remain quite conservative. Average loan to value ratios on new originations during the quarter were at 59% for single-family and 51% for multifamily and commercial real estate. Across all of our lending, we continue to be competitive with our relationship pricing, but we will not lower our underwriting standards to win new business.Business banking had yet another terrific quarter. Business loans outstanding grew nearly $800 million during the quarter driven by increased commitments as well as a higher line of credit utilization rate of 38% compared to 35% in the second quarter.Turning to deposits, it was another good quarter. Deposits were up $9.3 billion or 14% from a year-ago. We are very pleased with the diversification of our deposit base in terms of sources, type and product mix. In terms of sources, we gather deposits through private banking, business banking, private wealth management referrals, sweeps, and our preferred banking offices.",
                 'FISV': "At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv.Tiffany Willis - Fiserv, Inc.Thank you and good afternoon. I'm pleased to be here today in my new role leading Investor Relations. I look forward to connecting with many of you in the future. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, the acquisition of the debit processing and related solutions of Elan Financial Services, and the impact from tax reform. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.As a reminder, this year and per-share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials, and comments are adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split completed in March of this year, along with adjusting the comparable 2017 adjusted earnings per share amounts in each period for the sale of the majority interest of our Lending Solutions business, which closed in March.And with that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc.Thanks, Tiffany, nicely done on your first earnings call. Good afternoon to everyone joining us today.We delivered strong financial results, including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Additionally, internal revenue growth has been 5% over the rolling 12 months ending in this year's third quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and is up a very strong 26% year to date. We remain well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year while continuing to invest in your company.Free cash flow for the quarter was up 22% to $322 million and is over $800 million year to date, both of which include the divestiture impact of our Lending business. We continue to focus on share repurchase as our primary capital benchmark, allocating $438 million in the quarter and for the year to date have repurchased $1.2 billion.Before we dive into the results, let me provide perspective on the approximately $690 million acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services, which closed today. This acquisition, with annual revenue of over $170 million, extends our leadership in payments, broadens client reach and scale, and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing 3,000 debit solutions clients. We're excited about the opportunity to extend our payments franchise and welcome more than 300 talented associates to Fiserv.Scale is becoming increasingly important in the payments network and processing businesses. We have spent the last several years quietly migrating more than 1,200 clients to a single debit platform with our most advanced capabilities. We plan to leverage those experiences to successfully migrate the more than 1,000 acquired Elan clients to our platform over the next couple of years.We see revenue synergy opportunities across three primary areas. First, we have a number of solutions in our existing card portfolio to make available to the existing clients in areas such as the Accel Network, enhanced risk, card production, and digital capabilities such as Card Valet. The acquisition also provides a couple of new solutions which are additive to our portfolio and should contribute to internal revenue growth.As part of the transaction, we acquired Money Pass, the second largest surcharge-free ATM network in the U.S., with over 33,000 in-network ATMs. In addition, we acquired a small but strong ATM managed services capability, which extends our existing ATM offerings and payments differentiation.The third opportunity is to provide other Fiserv solutions outside of Card Payments, as the substantial majority of the acquired clients are not currently Fiserv account processing clients. Over time, we expect to compete for new revenue opportunities by demonstrating our solutions strength and integration advantage.Overall, we believe this synergy opportunity from consolidating to a scaled market-leading platform will add value to the acquired clients and deliver meaningful cost benefits over the next 24 months. We also believe the revenue synergies to be equally significant, but will have a longer ramp given existing client contracts and sales lead times. We generally expect to be at the revenue synergy run rate over a four-year to five-year period. Given synergy timing, we expect this transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings in 2019 and to grow over time.",
                 'FLT': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jim Eglseder, Head of Investor Relations for FLEETCOR Technologies. Thank you. You may begin.James P. Eglseder - FleetCor Technologies, Inc.Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you should have access to our third quarter press release and supplement, which can be found on our website at www.fleetcor.com, under the Investor Relations section.Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than other companies' non-GAAP information.Quantitative reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. Also, we are providing updated 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with reconciliations.Finally, before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. This includes forward-looking statements about our guidance and outlook, new products and fee initiatives, and expectations regarding business development and acquisitions. They are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance upon them.These results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at www.sec.gov.With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?Ronald F. Clarke - FleetCor Technologies, Inc.Okay. Jim, thanks, and it's good to be with everyone this afternoon. Upfront here I'll plan to cover two subjects. So first, I'll provide my view of the Q3 results, review our guidance for 2018, and provide a bit of a preview of 2019. And then second, I'll provide a progress update on our growth initiatives and M&A activities. Okay. So on to the quarter.We reported Q3 revenue of $620 million, up 12%, and cash EPS of $2.68, up 23%. So both revenue and cash EPS finishing at the high end of our guidance range.Organic growth, revenue growth, 11% for the quarter so quite good. Inside of that Fuel finished at 5%. And our nonfuel categories again very strong, Toll up 17%, Lodging up 21%, Corporate Pay up 28%, even Gift in the positive column, up 4%. So behind that some of the drivers of the performance.So in Fuel, a number of our Fuel card businesses doing quite well. Our cardlock business double digit from the fleet-wide extended network card, our Comdata Trucking business double digit through the rollout of this fuel and payroll card combo, and four of our international businesses, Russia, Mexico, Australia and the Netherlands, all double digit on the back of strong volume increases.Unfortunately, some of these high-growth fuel card businesses were offset by revenue declines in our GFN MasterCard and Chevron portfolios, which we're finally about to lap.Toll was up really on the strength of new sales, lots of new accounts added and lots from our new channels. And the client base grew a bit as the Brazil economy strengthened. Our usage-based pricing structure also added to the Toll growth.Lodging, up over 20%, mostly due to the small-business accounts growing very rapidly. In that segment, we're at three times the rate per transaction that we do in the large-account segment. We also benefited from increased usage from our existing hotel clients in part because of the ease of use of our new digital booking tool.Corporate Pay, another very good quarter, up 28%. The pure spend or volume growth in our direct construction and reseller channels, up over 20%. So simply put, just more business. Additionally, inside of Corporate Pay, our payroll card business up significantly, that was based on a pricing change from earlier in the year.So look, good performances across really all four of our product lines. Now onto the fundamentals or trends.So very consistent in the quarter, same-store sales up 1%. New sales up 6% with over 32,000 new clients signed. And customer retention improved to 92%, which is a tick better than Q2.So from our perspective, Q3, a solid quarter, good revenue and profit growth despite a not very helpful environment. Also continued steady fundamentals and trends.Okay. Let me transition over to rest of year guidance. So today we're raising 2018 full year cash EPS from $10.42 to $10.45 at the midpoint. That reflects our overperformance in the quarter. If we achieve Q4 cash EPS of $2.70 at the midpoint, that will result in full year 2018 EPS profit growth of 22%. Additionally, full year 2018 cash EPS of $10.45 would be 50% higher than full year 2016 cash EPS of $6.92. So profits up 50% in two years.",
                 'FLIR': "It is now my pleasure to introduce Jay Gentzkow, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Jay Gentzkow - FLIR Systems, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com/investor.Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations. Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.Please refer to the press release we issued earlier today for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasts. The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.We will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in this morning's earnings our press release.I'll now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems.James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.Thank you, Jay, and thank you, everyone, for joining FLIR's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With Jay and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO, Todd DuChene, General Counsel, Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit, Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit, and David Ray, President of our Government and Defense Business Unit. I'm also pleased to welcome Tony Buffum, who joined FLIR this month as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. Tony will lead the company's global HR team and drive all facets of change management and culture. Tony brings a wealth of experience and knowledge and we're thrilled to have him.As announced earlier this morning, we reported another solid quarter operationally and financially. Gross margins, operating margins, and operating cash flow reached quarterly levels we haven't seen in over five years. We also realized another quarter of double-digit EPS growth. And we maintained organic revenue growth in all business units despite challenging year-on-year comparables. Additionally, we're making meaningful progress on our continuous improvement initiatives through The FLIR Method. I'll start with third quarter review on slide three of the presentation with a few financial highlights. Carol will provide more color later during our prepared remarks.This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $435 million. Excluding revenue from acquisitions and divestitures, organic top-line growth was 3%. A very strong quarter in 2017 led by broad-based growth across all business units made for a difficult year-over-year comparable, but we're proud to deliver our fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth despite the lumpy nature of our end markets. While adjusted gross profit was flat versus third quarter 2017, adjusted gross margins improved significantly, up 330 basis points.Gross margin expansion was due to favorable product mix and productivity initiatives driven by The FLIR Method. Adjusted operating income increased 5% over the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating margin also improved, up 260 basis points in comparison to last year.While we're enthusiastic about achieving margin performance we haven't seen in years, we plan to continue balancing margin expansion with investments necessary to position FLIR for long-term profitable growth. This investment is especially key to franchise program wins, an essential part of the strategy we shared during our Investor Day in May. We'll share more information on our strategic investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call in February 2019.We also demonstrated solid operating leverage with adjusted earnings per share growing 10% in the quarter compared to Q3 2017. Operating cash flow reached $122 million for the quarter, the highest quarterly cash flow in over five years. Operating cash flow for the first nine months grew 32% over the same period of 2017.Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $591 million, down 1% compared to the balance at the end of the second quarter. While we grew backlog by more than 5% in our Government and Defense Business Unit during the quarter, our Industrial Business Unit continues to methodically lower backlog utilizing The FLIR Method to reduce customer lead times and more consistently position the business closer to a book and bill level.",
                 'FLS': "I will now turn the call over to Jay Roueche, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.John E.

We encourage you to fully review our Safe Harbor disclosures contained in yesterday's earnings materials, which are all available on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.Robert Scott Rowe - Flowserve Corp.Great. Thanks, Jay, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Flowserve delivered solid operational and financial results in the quarter; with strong bookings, revenue growth, and continued margin expansion. At a high level, I am pleased with the progress we've made to improve our visibility in oversight across our operations. This was the second consecutive quarter that each of our segments delivered on their targets and avoided the type of unforeseen issues that negatively impacted earnings in the past.Our confidence in our ability to set expectations, drive results, and deliver value for our customers, and shareholders has continued to grow with our progress. We believe we are building momentum heading into next year, as highlighted by our ability to deliver two consecutive solid quarters. As a result, we increased our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.65 to $1.75. We will go into this in more detail later in the call.We are encouraged by our progress, but recognize that we still have a lot of work in front of us. We're still in the early months of our multiyear Flowserve 2.0 initiative to transform our operating model, and we are now moving full speed ahead with our efforts to build a performance and accountability-driven culture that will drive the enhanced value that we believe is inherent within Flowserve.Let me briefly touch on some of the highlights of the quarter before going into greater detail. Our adjusted EPS of $0.49 was up 20% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Revenues grew almost 8% compared to the 2017 third quarter, with improvement in both adjusted gross and operating margins. Bookings growth across all segments drove our overall book-to-bill ratio to 1.06 for the quarter, highlighted by strong original equipment and aftermarket bookings. Our end markets continue to strengthen and we now fully expect to capitalize on the opportunities that are in front of us.Turning now to the detail on bookings. For the first time since the third quarter of 2015, we produced bookings over $1 billion in consecutive quarters. Overall, we delivered broad-based bookings growth in all industries we serve, with the exception of the power sector. Bookings grew 13.2% year-over-year, which includes a 2% headwind from currency and divestitures. Our bookings were primarily from smaller original equipment awards of less than $5 million and are focused on the aftermarket. Additionally, we were awarded some larger original equipment work in the refinery space that was driven by the change in regulation for refined shipping fuels.After three years of constrained maintenance spend, we have seen increased MRO spending over the last three quarters as our customers look to properly maintain their facilities. Our third quarter aftermarket bookings of $507 million represents the highest level since 2014 and was up nearly 12% year-over-year. An important aspect of our transformational efforts is to further capitalize on our significant installed base and our vast network of quick response centers. While we continue to see large projects move toward FID, Flowserve is a late cycle beneficiary of larger project work. We remain encouraged by the increased visibility we have into those opportunities and believe that many of these will come into fruition in 2019 and 2020.Over the last several months, our confidence has increased regarding what is in the pipeline and when we'll likely to see increased project bookings. While forecasting any one quarter of bookings is always a challenge, we are optimistic our approved end markets, active quoting funnel, and solid capture rate will continue to support increased bookings for the fourth quarter, generating a healthy backlog going into 2019.",

David?David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our third quarter results relative to our preannouncement three weeks ago and discuss our outlook for the rest of this year.Earnings attributable to Fluor in the third quarter were $77 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $94 million and $0.67 per diluted share a year ago. Bruce will talk about the financial details in his discussion.If you turn to slide 3. For the third quarter new awards for Energy & Chemical segment were $644 million and ending backlog was $11.4 billion. At the beginning of October, the consortium behind the LNG Canada project reached a final investment decision with final notice to proceed being received this week. Fluor will book its $8.4 billion share of the approximately $14 billion contract in the fourth quarter.Throughout the bidding and planning process for the LNG Canada project we have focused on identifying the biggest obstacles to success in creating a comprehensive mitigation strategy. We've relied on our zero-based execution approach, in addition to our supply chain and fabrication capability to enhance productivity and cost control.We believe these key advantages along with our data driven execution approach provide a distinct competitive advantage for the large EPC project clients are developing. We continue to see a number of advantage projects that fit our pursuit profile over the next several quarters. These include LNG projects in Mozambique, chemical facilities including methanol facilities in the Gulf Coast, as well as further cracker complexes.Turning to side 4, the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power group reported new awards of $5.4 billion for the third quarter and ending backlog with $16.5 million. This quarter we booked the Quellaveco copper mine in Peru and the Gordie Howe international bridge connecting Detroit, Windsor Canada.Our mining backlog, within that group continues to grow and now stands at $8.1 billion, up from $4.8 billion in the last quarter. Building off our success in mining and infrastructure we're currently tracking prospects in copper, gold and bauxite for infrastructure, and we're continuing currently pursuing projects in Illinois, Virginia and Texas.Turning to slide 5, the Government group reported new awards for the quarter of $3.3 billion, which included the DOE extension in Savannah River through 2019, Portsmouth D&D contract through 2021 and the strategic petroleum reserve contract through 2024. Ending backlog was $5.1 billion. For 2009 (sic) [2019] (4:59), we are well positioned to win the liquid waste contract at Savannah River and the LOGCAP V contract.If you turn to slide 6, in the Diversified Services segment, they reported new awards of $336 million, which includes a two-year extension for Stork's delivery integrator specialist, asset integrity services for the offshore production platforms located in Central North Sea. Ending backlog for the quarter is $2 billion. While revenue for the quarter was lighter than our expectation, this is the first time we've seen a book-to-bill ratio above 2.0 in the last 10 years. We believe this is a meaningful indicator of a strong beginning to the cycle.",
                 'FMC': "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. You may begin.Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2018 and the fourth quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. All three will then address your questions.The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and the 2018 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call.Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for both businesses at the revenue and earnings level. It also was a quarter for executing on our commitments. The Ag Solutions business performed very well in a seasonally weak Q3, driving 5% pro forma sales growth, which was about 300 basis points higher than our forecast, despite an estimated 4% to 5% headwind from foreign currencies.Revenue synergy continued to boost results and demand in Brazil was very strong in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not have precise data from DuPont in 2017 to calculate exact year-over-year impact from FX, pricing, or volume, but we base our FX estimates on what we saw in our legacy businesses.In Q3, we successfully transferred to FMC delayed sites and country from the DuPont acquisition. As discussed on our last earnings calls, these transfers did result in a shift of revenue into Q4 that was in line with our expectation, but they will not result in any missed sale for the full year. There remain one more delayed transfer, a small formulation site in India, that will occur in the second half of 2019. We expect no impact on business results.On business integration is on schedule and we have begun the systematic rollout of the new SAP S/4HANA system starting with our corporate finance function. The complete rollout will be implemented by the end of 2019.On the technology front, we are on track to launch our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline in North America in the first quarter of 2019. This fungicide will be branded Lucento, and is based on the active ingredient Bixafen.Our Lithium segment performed strongly in Q3, and we successfully completed the IPO of approximately 15% of Livent Corporation on schedule last month to begin the separation of that business. Last night, we announced our intent to spin-off the remaining 85% to FMC shareholders in the form of a dividend of Livent's shares on March 1, 2019. The spin will complete the full separation and is expected to be tax-free to FMC shareholders.FMC Lithium will remain a reporting segment of FMC in the fourth quarter of this year, but will be reported as discontinued operations when we report first quarter results next year, assuming the spin is completed in March.We have significantly reduced debt this year, having paid down nearly $600 million of debt through October. Andrew will expand on this topic later on the call and describe the rationale for an announcement to buy back $200 million of FMC stocks by year-end. Our five-year strategic plan is complete and being implemented. We will share it with you at our Investor Day on December 3.We are proud that we have been able to make significant progress on all our major initiatives that we set out to accomplish at the beginning of this year, including the DuPont integration, our SAP S/4HANA implementation and the completion of the Livent IPO, while delivering strong quarterly results.Turning now to slide 3 and our third quarter results. FMC reported third quarter revenue of just over $1 billion, which was 60% higher than Q3 2017. Adjusted EPS was $0.98 in the quarter, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 40% versus the same period a year ago. The guidance beat was due to the strong performance of Ag Solutions, a $0.07 beat, plus $0.01 from Lithium and $0.03 from the lower tax rate, offset somewhat by a $0.05 headwind from higher-than-expected corporate cost and other costs. Andrew will address the higher corporate cost in his section.",

Mr. Lance, you may begin.Jim LanceThank you, Vincent. Welcome everyone to Foot Locker, Inc.'s third quarter earnings conference call.As reported in today's press release, the company reported net income of $130 million in the third quarter compared to $102 million in the third quarter of last year. On a GAAP basis, this year's net income was $1.14 per share compared to $0.81 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Included in these results is an incremental pretax charge of $2 million related to the pension litigation matter we have previously disclosed, offset by $23 million of tax benefits from adjustments to the effects of several provisions of last year's U.S. Tax Reform Bill as detailed in today's press release. Included in last year's earnings per share is a $13 million pretax charge due to reducing and reorganizing our divisional and corporate staff. Excluding these items on an non-GAAP basis, third quarter earnings were $0.95 per share, a 9% increase versus last year's $0.87 per share.Unless otherwise noted, the figures and rates mentioned during our call today will be based on non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's press release.We will begin our prepared remarks with Lauren Peters, Foot Locker's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide details on our third quarter financial results along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter. Dick Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an update on our ongoing initiatives and provide some highlights from our third quarter performance.So with that, we have a lot to cover. So let's get started. Lauren?Lauren PetersThank you, Jim, and good evening everyone. I appreciate that all of you were able to join us tonight ahead of your holiday festivities. As noted in our press release this afternoon, the company generated a 2.9% comparable sales gain during the third quarter, our best results of the year, and in line with our previous guidance. This is a solid result, especially as it reflects the building momentum that we see in our business. It included more full price selling during the period with gross margin improvement above our expectations.Looking at the sales gains by month, we saw our comparable sales accelerate nicely as we move through the quarter with August up low single digits followed by mid-single digit comp gains in both, September and October. Our total reported sales declined slightly during the quarter; as we mentioned on our previous call in August, the 53rd week shift reduced sales in Q3 by about $60 million. In addition, the impact from foreign currencies is typically the stronger dollar reduced sales by $17 million. Excluding these factors, total reported sales would have been. I'm pleased to report that we produced solid gains across both channels with comps sales at our stores, up 2.4%, and digital, up 5.9%. This once again demonstrates the importance of connecting with our customers and serving them, however, they choose to shop. As a percent of total sales, DTC was 14.5% for the quarter, up from 13.8% last year.The story with traffic this quarter was also one of sequential improvement led by a modest increase at our U.S. store banners. Traffic at our international banners was down low single digits. While still a challenge, it was an improvement over the prior period trends with notable progress at Foot Locker Europe stores. Average selling prices continue to move higher, both in footwear and apparel; unit sales were also up in footwear while apparent units were down a few ticks.Looking at our families to business; footwear turned positive posting it's first comp gain in six quarters with a low single-digit increase. While the strong trend in apparel continued with a high single-digit comp gain fueled by branded assortments. Accessories such as hats and socks comp down double-digits. Within footwear our women's business was the strongest performer with comparable sales up double-digits. Men's was up low single-digits, and kids was up slightly. Men's running comps were up double-digits and while basketball was down mid-single digits, the trend did get better from the second quarter. Meanwhile casual including styles from [indiscernible] and seasonal assortment such as boots had another solid quarter, posting a mid-single digit comp gain.",
                 'F': "I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.Thank you, Ian. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President of Global Operations; and Brian Schaff, CFO of Ford Credit.Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled earlier this year, which we now call Creating Tomorrow, Together. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then we'll open the call for questions. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.Today's discussions include forward looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated. And the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 35. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year. Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.Now let me turn the call over to Jim.James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.Thanks, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'll briefly cover three topics before I turn it over to Bob for more detail and then we'll take your questions. First, let me provide an overview of third quarter results and our 2018 guidance, which remains unchanged. And then second, I'd like to share with you specific detail on the progress we're making against our strategy to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then third, I want to provide a look ahead at a number of upcoming touch points we'll have with investors and provide an update on our midterm guidance. So let's get started.If you would, please turn to slide 2. Starting with the quarter, top line grew 3% in the face of significant global sector-wide headwinds and our company EBIT margin was sequentially unchanged, despite substantially lower volume. Our North America performance was strong with an EBIT margin of nearly 9%. And I have to say that the North American leadership team has done a great job optimizing every opportunity to improve growth and returns. And now, we're heading into a really busy and exciting period of product renewal, which you'll hear more about.I believe North America results demonstrate the early evidence that our fitness actions and commitment to focus on higher return opportunities are now taking hold and this is driving a more resilient business model. Within North America results this quarter, we achieved a $1 billion mix improvement from our strong product line focus, including more F-150s and more Super Duties that had record transaction prices.And additionally, the F-Series share of the full-size pickup segment increased in the quarter and Ford continued to be the number one best-selling brand in the U.S. We also remain the number one selling brand for commercial vehicles in Europe. In fact, we gained commercial vehicle share, reaching our highest quarterly share in over 25 years. In addition, we delivered record year to-date sales of Ranger in Asia Pacific.I'm delighted that our earlier proclamations that we can find that right winning portfolio has this positive news in the quarter. Our future work on our portfolio is directed at making this even better. In addition, Ford Credit quarterly results were the best since 2011. We delivered positive company operating cash flow and we generated earnings per share of $0.29. Our balance sheet and available liquidity remain at healthy levels. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. In the quarter, we had over $23 billion of company cash and our target balance of $20 billion with liquidity over $34 billion.Well, turning to the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of a range of $1.30 to $1.50 and positive cash flow, albeit lower than 2017.So now let's go to page 3. This framework, which we have shown before, illustrates our plan for creating value for our stakeholders. At the highest level, the obvious strength of our F-Series trucks and our Transit family of commercial vehicles has positively driven margin in recent years. When I look back at these successes, there's not much I would have wanted to change. But it's clear these strengths probably masked weaknesses in the fitness of our overall business and also shrouded poor design elements of other areas of the business where we destroyed value.To be a great company, my message to everyone is, we have to attack this opportunity. In answer to the question, what have we again been working on this past year? We've developed and implemented a plan to redesign the company to dramatically improve the fitness of the overall business, address those areas of weakness I just pointed out and prepare Ford to win in a fast-changing future. Our mission is to build on our traditional strengths, while capitalizing on the sweeping changes brought about by propulsion technology, shared mobility and artificial intelligence that are all ushering in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world.",

Organically built from ground up from two decades of innovation, the Security Fabric provides the best automation and integration in the industry.An example is our Security Fabric cloud offering on Azure. We now provide the most extensive offering of integrated security solution available on Azure including FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall, FortiSandbox, FortiCASB, FortiWeb, FortiMail, FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer's.A second differentiator is our superior price to performance capabilities. Fortinet is the only security company that build ASIC security processor, SPU, with integrated security and a network functionality, which provide a 10x the speed and performance of other software products. As a result, Fortinet's product provides significantly better security performance for both cloud and edge computing.The third competitive differentiator in our Security Fabric platform is the extensive third-party recognition and validation we have received from NSS Labs and Gartner. Fortinet has received recommended rating in nine out of nine NSS Lab categories, more than double the number of recommendations received by our nearest competitors. Fortinet was among the only three vendors out of 10 that received a recommendation for their SD-WAN solution and the only vendor to have received recommended rating in both SD-WAN and the Next-Generation Firewall group tests.Fortinet's Fabric platform solution have now appeared in seven Gartner Magic Quadrant over the past 12 months. Our SD-WAN solution was recognized as one of the top five solutions in Gartner's WAN Edge Magic Quadrant. Also, Fortinet was named in leader's quadrant for next-generation enterprise firewall and unified threat management.",

Today, we reported strong high teens adjusted earnings growth for the third quarter reflecting the underlying strength of our core portfolio, the power of the Fortive business system and the increasing momentum of our M&A flywheel. Given our strong free cash flow generation and a healthy balance sheet, we are in an advantaged position to continue driving organic growth while pursuing acquisitions to accelerate the achievement of our strategy.During the third quarter, we closed the $775 million acquisition of Gordian and the $2 billion acquisition of Accruent. Through the application of FPS, we were also able to close the divestiture of the automation and specialty businesses to Altra, well ahead of schedule on October 1. In total, we have now announced $8.2 billion of transactions in 2018, $5.5 billion of which have already been closed.We have done so while maintaining our commitment to a strong balance sheet based on our consistent free cash flow performance as well as the successful execution of our mandatory convertible preferred stock offering in the second quarter. Taken together, these transactions significantly advance our portfolio enhancement efforts aimed at increasing growth and reducing cyclicality across the portfolio. The Gordian and Accruent acquisitions provide entry into attractive markets characterized by strong long-term growth trends and limited cyclicality. They also represent the continued execution of our digital strategy to address a range of critical software-enabled workflows for our customers through the acquisition of quality software assets with high margins and significant recurring revenue.During the quarter, we also continue to make progress toward the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Advanced Sterilization Products. Based on close collaboration with our partners at Johnson & Johnson and our continued application of FPS, we successfully completed the requisite European Works Council consultations and cleared key regulatory hurdles paving the way for the formal acceptance of our binding offer on September 20. We continue to expect to close the transaction in early 2019.The third quarter represented the opportunity to demonstrate all that is special about the Fortive team as we responded to Hurricane Florence and other recent natural disasters around the world and showed our commitment to our local communities through our annual day of caring. Over the past two weeks, our employees participated in hundreds of events including working with food banks, improving children shelters, and building houses for the low income and homeless. Coming together to support our communities as never been more important for the long-term success of our company and the communities in which we work. With that I'd like to turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings of $321.1 million were up 18.2% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.86 based on an adjusted effective tax rate a 17.2% for the quarter. Sales grew 9.2% to 1.8 billion reflecting a core revenue increase of 3.2% driven by strong growth across industrial technologies as well as Fluke, Industrial Scientific, and Gems.",
                 'FBHS': "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Lantz, Senior Vice President of Communications and Corporate Administration. You may begin your conference call.Brian C. Lantz - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security Quarterly Investor Conference Call and Webcast. We're pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the third quarter of 2018. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier. The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the Investors section of our fbhs.com website.I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements we make on the call today, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session, are based on current expectations and our market outlook and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. These risks are detailed in our various filing with the SEC such as our Annual Report on 10-K.The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made. Any references to operating profit, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will focus on our results on a before charges and gains basis for continuing operations with the exception of cash flow unless otherwise specified.With me on the call today are Chris Klein, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pat Hallinan, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.I will now turn the call over to Chris.Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams managed to grow sales and EPS in the third quarter, despite the summer and early fall market that was slower than expected and the impact of Hurricane Florence on our North Carolina operations.The market's been growing at a slower pace since July and running at the lower end of our planning range. There's more moderate growth period, it's not unlike other pauses that we've seen throughout this recovery as buyers, sellers and renters adjust to changes in affordability in local markets around the country.Even with this market moderation, consumer demand for our Home & Security products continues to be solid overall. R&R, which accounts for about two-thirds of our business, remained stable at mid-single digit growth rate for the eighth consecutive year.Additionally, our Plumbing and Doors momentum continues to be strong and the disciplined actions that we've taken all year on price and supply chain to offset inflationary pressures are having a greater effect.So, despite the more uncertain environment and third quarter results that are not as we expected, we continues to execute aggressively against our plans. We are managing costs tightly, adjusting supply chains to address inflation and tariffs, launching new products and getting price. Even with significant headwinds and inflationary pressures, our sales and margin are holding in advance of further actions we are taking to improve each business.We're adjusting our full-year guidance down to reflect our third quarter results, the impact of our recent acquisition and bond financing, and an assumption of market growth that is at the bottom end of our range for the balance of the year.Let me first take you through our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the third quarter and the effect of tariffs on our business. Pat will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and the 2018 outlook.Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market, growth rates in the market for our home products moderated during the summer and early fall, particularly relating to single family new construction as consumers adjusted expectations on interest rates and price against a limited supply of housing.In the quarter, we estimate repair and remodel activity grew at about 5%, and new construction grew at about 6% to 7%, reflecting the low end of our full-year expectation.Our updated 2018 annual outlook is based on revised assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined rate of 5% for the year versus our initial estimate of 5% to 7%, which is still solid growth even at a more moderate rate.Also, the fundamental drivers of our market, which include employment, wage growth, household formations and consumer confidence, all continue to remain positive. Before getting into the details on the quarter, let me provide some additional high-level thoughts on our current view.",
                 'BEN': "Good morning. My name is Omar and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.Greg JohnsonHello and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I’m joined today by Ken Lewis, our CFO. While some clear challenges persist during the quarter, investment performance within our growth strategies was very strong and net flows into our US equity and hybrid products improved. US equity sales reached the highest level in three years, driven by demand for a number of growth funds within the category. Additionally, we continue to make progress with several strategic initiatives to offer lower cost options to investors, notably in the DCIO space. Importantly, operating results remained strong with over 503 million of operating income generated on 1.6 billion of revenue in the quarter. We continue to prioritize capital return with elevated share repurchase activity in the quarter and a $0.23 per share regular quarterly dividend.We’d now like to open the line to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler, Credit Suisse.Craig SiegenthalerOn page 4 of the prepared remarks, I see you adjusted fee structures in your A share, so I’m just wondering how large is this A share from an AUM based standpoint and also what’s the estimated economic impact in terms of EPS or revenues or earnings?Ken LewisYeah. I mean, I don't think we have a number. I think it -- I would say, it would be nominal any impact. It's really just adjusting the payout schedule to be more competitive on the breakpoint schedules and we think the real impact would be in the lower duration kind of products where we've seen a lot of over million dollar sales, being competitive on the brokerage side of those still selling A share assets. So, I just don't think it is a number that would adjust anything at this stage. Hopefully it will if we get strong sales.Greg JohnsonRight. We think, it will increase sales, and if it does increase sales, then you would see the sales distribution revenue and expense line increase, which is a good thing.Craig SiegenthalerAnd then just as my follow-up, I don't know if you guys did this intentionally, but it looks like you pulled the tax and commentary around the pipeline in the prepared remarks. I'm just wondering how did the institutional one up and not yet funded pipeline trend from next quarter?Ken LewisWell, I think that the -- was the question how the pipeline related back to last quarter?Craig SiegenthalerYes. So how did the institutional pipeline of one yet not yet funded mandates trend the current right now versus three months ago?Ken LewisYeah. I think, for example, the big win for our local asset management in the UK, I don't think, we noted that last quarter. So that was an upside surprise, but I would say for, the pipeline came in pretty much, for the rest of the pipeline, it came in pretty much as we expected.OperatorOur next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi.Bill KatzSo first question is just on expenses. Appreciate that you – sorry, some background noise. So just appreciate the guidance, as it relates to the fourth quarter on the G&A side. So I guess first part of the question is, where is the spend? It sounds like there is a little lumpiness to it? And then now that you’re so close to the end of the year, how are you thinking about the growth next year, relative to the growth rate you articulated for this year?Ken LewisRight. There were a few one-time charges in the G&A, but there's also -- there was a bit of kind of expense trends going on in there as well. So that's why we gave the guidance. Some of it relates to sub-advisory expense, so you're seeing an offset to that in revenue as well. But I think that's probably the biggest driver there and so that's why we're giving that guidance for the fourth quarter. I mean, it's early in the budget process for us looking forward to next year, but our target is to try to keep the expenses under 3% growth rate next year, year-over-year, ’19 versus ’18.",
                 'FCX': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.Before we begin our comments, we want to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We want to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.Richard Adkerson is on the call today, as well as Red Conger, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our prepared slides for today's call. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $556 million, or $0.38 per share, for the third quarter of 2018. The results included net gains of $42 million, or $0.03 per share, which primarily reflected adjustments to assets held for sale and the fair value of potential contingent consideration, partly offset by non-recurring charges associated with a new three-year collective labor agreement at Cerro Verde. After adjusting for these net gains, our adjusted net income totaled $514 million, or $0.35 per share.Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the third quarter totaled $1.8 billion, and there's a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculation on page 27 of our slide deck. We reported strong sales during the quarter. Our copper sales exceeded 1 billion pounds of copper, gold sales totaled 837,000 ounces, and molybdenum sales were 22 million pounds in the third quarter. These sales – the copper sales were 8% higher than our previous guidance and gold sales were 20% higher, and this principally reflects higher ore grades and operating rates in Indonesia as we mine the final phases of the Grasberg open pit. In addition, we are confirming in all material respects our operational outlook guidance in the coming years.Our third quarter average copper price realized was $2.80 per pound. That was below last year's third quarter average of $2.94 per pound. And our gold average realization was $1,191 per quarter, and that was also below last year's third quarter of $1,290 per ounce. For the third quarter, our average unit net cash cost for our mines averaged $0.93 per pound. That reflects a strong performance from our global operations and the continued focus on productivity and cost management. The $0.93 also includes $0.07 per pound of copper associated with nonrecurring charges for the Cerro Verde three-year labor agreement that I mentioned previously.We generated strong operating cash flows in the third quarter, which totaled $1.25 billion, and those exceeded capital expenditures of $500 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $4.6 billion and consolidated debt of $11.1 billion. Our net debt at the end of September was $6.6 billion, and that continues with our deleveraging that we've had over the last several quarters. We ended the period with a strong liquidity position. In addition to our cash position, we also have a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and have no borrowings under that facility.Our board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share under the new policy that was established earlier this year, and that dividend will be paid – that quarterly dividend will be paid on November 1.I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be providing additional details and referring to our slide presentation materials.Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.Good morning, everyone. As we'll be talking about, as I do review these highlights, it's been a very active quarter for us here at FCX. Results from our global mining operations have been solid. Our teams continue to execute our plans in a very effective way. In Indonesia, we had an important milestone in progressing our efforts to reach stabilization of our business there in terms of our negotiations with the government with the signing of definitive divestment agreements on September 27.Operations, current operations in Papua have been strong, and we've made important progress in transitioning the Grasberg ore body mining from open pit to underground, so we'll talk about that.We are continuing our sharp focus on the important things about our business to build shareholder value. Our unit net cost are at $0.93 a pound, significantly below last year and in line with our plans, it does reflect for the nine months $0.02 as a result of the successful settlement of our labor situation in Cerro Verde and Peru, so that was very good.Operating cash flows exceeded CapEx in the third quarter by $740 million, about (sic) $2.5 billion to-date. Net debt, as Kathleen mentioned, is down $2 billion from the start of the year. And this agreement with Inalum is really important. It establishes the path to reaching long-term stability and de-risk our operations over the long-term in Indonesia.",
                 'GPS': "I would now like to introduce your host, Tina Romani, Senior Director of Investor Relations.Tina RomaniGood afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gap, Inc.'s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the information made available on this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as the description and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures, as noted on Page 2 of the slides supplementing Teri's remarks, please refer to today's earnings press release, as well as our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are available on gapinc.com. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 20, 2018, and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.Joining me on the call today are President and CEO, Art Peck; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Teri List-Stoll. As mentioned, we will be using slides to supplement our remarks, which you can view by going to the Investors sections at gapinc.com. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call for further questions.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Art.Art PeckGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Q3 conference call. You’ve obviously seen the press release with our third quarter results which generally fell within our expectations and reflect the continued positive performance of Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta.That said, I suspect you like we are most focused on the results of Gap brand. While the performance of Gap brand this quarter was not entirely surprising, clearly we’re disappointed and we need to do better. We continue to feel the impact of last year’s operational missteps in the business, but we also face more fundamental issues with the brand namely the specialty fleet.I’ll talk first about the current performance, trends, and then I’ll turn to the more significant structural issues. As we said on our last call, once we identified the operational issues we made the decision to make aggressive but necessary cuts to rightsize the assortment including reducing SKU count by 30%.The Q3 assortment was affected most dramatically as we have less flexibility to pullback units without impacting the overall assortment architecture. As such, entering Q3 we had some known imbalances in the assortment. We made these cuts intentionally and these imbalances were known. This mainly affected tops but it also impacted the assortment breadth and depth behind key styles.For perspective, the average tops to bottom ratio is generally about 3:1 and we are at about half that in Q3. This has an impact on conversion which was more severe than we anticipated driving sharper discounts to clear inventory and position ourselves for a healthier Q4. I now have the benefit of hindsight, and with that hindsight I am still quite confident that the decisions that we made were the best financial decisions.I want to share, however, where the assortment is in Q4 compared to Q3. Programs and CCs are down 30% providing a narrower but better architected assortment. Tops to bottom ratios have moved from about 1.7 to 2.8, which is much closer to the norm. Depth behind CCs and our key items which particularly impacts service levels is up 18%. With that, Q4 is better positioned. We expect an improvement from Q3 trends in both comp and margin and the early reads of our Q4 product flows are encouraging.Let me take you back and review a few things about Gap brand over the last several months. In late June, we named a new brand President at Gap, Neil Fiske. Stabilizing the business has been his first priority. As you would expect, he’s assessed the business, the organization, and the underlying processes and is well into developing his plans.Over the last several weeks, we’ve landed additional key leaders with impressive credentials, including, and I’m very excited about this, Pam Wallack from Children's Place to lead North American specialty. This is a role similar to the one that she previously held when she was working directly for me when I was running the brand in 2012.I’m pleased with the progress that Neil is making. Importantly, the actions we’re taking are the foundation for improved margin, expense reduction, and the increased profitability that is required for the brand to be a contributor to shareholder value.Okay. All that said, the biggest challenge with Gap brand is largely a function of certain legacy elements which we understand and recognize of the brand. A big one specifically is the real estate obligations that currently encumber the business.",
                 'GRMN': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited third quarter 2018 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.As a reminder, we adopted the new U.S. GAAP revenue standards in the first quarter 2018. The prior periods presented here have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins, and future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone.I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications of technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come.Moving now to the quarterly results, earlier today Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year, operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97, and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first three quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance.Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.Starting with the marine segment, revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer boating season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14% respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content.We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as manufacturer of the year and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award.We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry and we will continue to invest in this segment to maximize its potential.Turning next to aviation, revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within this segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have began integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.Turning next to the fitness segment, revenue increased 14% primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20% respectively and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim smart activity tracker that includes a pulse ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line along with new mobile app adventures.",
                 'IT': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Cohen, Gartner's GVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.David Cohen - Gartner, Inc.Thank you, Denise, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call include a discussion of third quarter 2018 financial results and our current outlook for 2018 as disclosed in today's press release.In addition to today's press release, we have provided an expanded supplemental document for investors and analysts, in which we provide a detailed review of our financials and business metrics. And the supplemental document included a full non-GAAP P&L, excluding all the divested operations. This table combines Heritage Gartner and Heritage CEB, and removes the operating results of the divestitures starting January 1, 2017.For 2018, the table provides results as if we had used the net proceeds from the divestitures to repay debt on December 31, 2017. This gives you a view down to adjusted EPS for 2018 that reflects how we are thinking about the business as we plan for 2019. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise We've posted the press release and supplemental PDF to our website, investor.gartner.com. Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for questions.On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to revenue and contribution margin are for adjusted revenue excluding divested operations and adjusted contribution margin excluding divested operations which exclude the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments and the recently divested businesses.All references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA excluding divested operations with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and excluding the divested operations. All cash flow numbers unless stated otherwise are as reported with no adjustments related to the divested operations.

In the earnings supplemental, the abbreviation ex D.O. indicates that the metric excludes divested operations.As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in those documents.Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.Good morning and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. We drove another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Q3 with total revenues up 13% and EBITDA up 17%. We continue to see strength within each of our three businesses; Research, Consulting and Events. Research revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Consulting revenue was up 10% year-over-year with backlog up 18% on a reported basis. On a same-event basis, Events revenue was up 21% and the number of attendees was up 17% year-over-year.We continue to apply the Gartner Formula for growth to both Global Technology Sales and to Global Business Sales. Global Technology Sales was up 14% and again delivered double-digit growth in every region across every size company and in virtually every industry. We continue to pursue the enormous growth opportunity with our GTS clients and prospects.We also have an enormous growth opportunity by applying the Gartner Formula to GBS. Applying the Gartner Formula has required an unusually large amount of change for GBS during 2017 and 2018. We restructured the organization. We eliminated discounting and reconfigured contract terms and conditions. We introduced seat-based offerings and made many more changes. These changes put in place the foundation for sustained double-digit growth in the future. Change of this magnitude puts everyone affected on a new learning curve and this impacted short-term productivity, as we expected.Looking to the future with much of the foundation in place, we expect our teams will advance on the learning curve, resulting in sustained double-digit growth. First, our GBS leadership team and salespeople understand and are fully bought in to the Gartner Formula. They have the will. They're determined to succeed and they're incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. With this determination and excitement, their skills in executing the Gartner Formula are getting better every day.Clients appreciate the strong value proposition in our new seat-based products. As a result, over the past three quarters, the proportion of our salespeople who sold their first seat-based deal has grown rapidly. And once they've sold their first deal, salespeople quickly accelerate in selling their second, third and more. As you might expect, the proportion of a seat-based contract value has also rapidly grown.",
                 'GD': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 for fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion, and income from continuing operations of $864 million. The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20%, attributable in large part to the CSRA acquisition. However, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All five reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter.Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction. In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings absent the amortization expense related to the transaction were $1.2 billion with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million, or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The two quarters were very much alike.On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion, or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million, or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures at Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the nine months, as the business units continued to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements.As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year, and $5.6 billion increase over the year-ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2 times and a sharp increase in its estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4.Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million, or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat, off $5 million, or 1.3%, to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million, or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins, as expected. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million, or 6.4%, and operating earnings are off $133 million, or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin.The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago.We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollars values of orders. Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding NORDAM's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and G600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That, I am pleased to say, is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake.",
                 'GE': "Todd Ernst - General Electric Co.Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to GE's third quarter earnings webcast. I'm joined this morning by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp, and CFO Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation, supplemental and 10-Q have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking statements and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filing and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Larry.H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.Todd, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot to share with you, so let's get to it. During the third quarter, we saw positive results in most segments with outstanding performance in our Aviation (01:36-02:19)Now, I know there's been renewed speculation on our future strategic direction. The strategy we announced on June 26 to create a more focused portfolio that sets up our businesses to win and strengthening our balance sheet is today the right plan going forward.Consistent with this strategy, we are announcing two actions this morning. First, GE plans to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.01 per share beginning with the board's next dividend declaration which is expected to occur in December 2018. This change will allow GE to retain about $3.9 billion of cash per year compared to the prior payout level. Going forward, we will target a dividend payout ratio in line with peers over time.Second, we will take a materially different approach to running our Power business. The past 30 days I've spent a lot of time with Russell Stokes and his team It has become clear to us that we need to simplify the business structure. Therefore today we are announcing our intent to reorganize Power into two units, both of which will report directly to me. The first is a unified Gas lifecycle business combining our product and services group gas power systems and power services with the second constituting the portfolio of Steam, Grid, Nuclear, and Power Conversion.Additionally we intend to consolidate the Power headquarters, Gas Power systems and Power Services teams into the new Gas lifecycle business, effectively eliminating the Power headquarters structure. We have much more to do to improve our performance in Power and we intend to move quickly to enhance our execution agility and improve our cost structure.These actions are a start in bolstering GE for the road ahead. In the last month I have visited many of our primary business locations. Getting to know this company better from the inside has only strengthened my conviction that GE has considerable strengths. The talent here is real, the technology is special. And the global reach of the GE brand and our relationships are truly impressive.But GE needs to change. Our team knows this. In my old job we acquired dozens of good but often underperforming businesses. We always came prepared to convince the acquired teams that they and we needed to drive change. That is not the case here. Our GE team needs no convincing.They really want direction to know how to change. And while I don't have all the answers after one month, I do have a few early impressions. We could use a lot more out and a good bit less up around here, meaning we need to focus more on customers and competition and, frankly, less on corporate.We're going to strike a better balance between managing and reporting so that we ensure we're properly focused on the daily operating rhythms which drive our actual financial results well ahead of our reporting cycles. Strong daily management makes reporting a lot easier. First things firstAnd we need to accelerate our progress on cash generation. Changes to our compensation system and internal reporting this year were a good start but we need to operationalize real improvements on cash through business processes in every business every day.And with that, let me turn it to Jamie for a more detailed discussion of the quarter.",
                 'GIS': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Jeff SiemonThanks, Nelson, and good morning to everybody. I'm here with Jeff Harmening, our Chariman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO. I'll hand the call over to them in a moment, but before I do, let me cover a few items.Our press release on third quarter results was issued this morning over the wire services and you can find the release and the copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning on our Investor Relations website. I will remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions and that the second slide in today's presentation list factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.Jeffrey HarmeningThanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Let's jump right in and cover the key messages for today.Our primary goal during fiscal 2018 has been to strengthen our top line performance while maintaining our efficiency; we're delivering on the first part of that goal with stronger innovation, more impactful consumer news and better in-store execution leading to a second consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. We're also generating significant growth and free cash flow through strong capital discipline. As a result, we're reaffirming our full year organic net sales and free cash flow targets.While I feel good about our results on net sales and cash, I'm disappointed in our profit performance this quarter. Our third quarter operating profit fell well short of our expectations and our full year outlook has been impacted by an increase in supply chain costs in a dynamic cost environment. We're moving urgently to address these rising cost pressures, we've taken actions to improve profitability in the near-term and we've launched initiatives that will reduce our long-term cost structure. While these actions will only partially offset the cost headwinds in fiscal 2018, we still expect to deliver profit growth in the fourth quarter; and we're confident these actions will strengthen our bottom line results beginning in fiscal 2019. Beyond our current results and outlook, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value with our consumer for strategy which will be further strengthened with the addition of Blue Buffalo to our family of brands.Before turning it over to Don to cover our financial results, let me share some details on the cost increases driving our revised profit outlook, and the steps we're taking to mitigate these increased costs going forward.Between incremental costs we identified as we closed the books in the third quarter and a more unfavorable cost outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we now expect our full year fiscal '18 total segment operating profit will be 5% to 6% below year ago levels in constant currency. The key driver of this change is a significant increase in supply chain costs which falls into two main areas; first, their input costs are rising faster than we had anticipated, in fact, we now estimate our full year fiscal '18 input cost inflation will be 4%, 1 point higher than our previous estimate.We called out an increased freight costs that are upto CAGNY but the cost pressure we're seeing is even higher than we thought at that time. We're now having to go out to the spot market for close to 20% of our shipments versus the historic average of about 5%, and those spot market prices can be 30% to 60% higher than our contracted rates. In fact North American freight spot prices were near 20-year highs in February. Higher freight costs are impacting our raw material prices as well as the cost to ship materials from our suppliers to our factories has risen significantly. And we've seen higher prices in some key commodities including grains, fruits and nuts, further heightening the inflationary dynamic.The second main area of supply chain cost pressure is increased operational costs driven by higher volumes running through our network. We've seen increased volume on some capacity constrained platforms and stronger results for our new products. And while I'm pleased with our increased volume performance, those factors are mainly utilizing more external manufacturing where conversion cost can be significantly higher than our internal platforms. Additionally, we've seen increased expenses from intra-network shipments between our distribution centers as we move more products to the right locations to satisfy the strong demand.We're moving urgently to address this increasingly dynamic cost inflation environment and ensure that negative profit impact is limited to fiscal 2018. Some of the actions we're taking will have an impact already this fiscal year. We're addressing higher freight costs in the near-term by qualifying more carriers and utilizing different modes of transportation. We're placing increasingly tight control over all expenses in the balance of this year. We're also taking smart actions to drive positive net price realization in a higher cost environment by pulling various levers within our strategic revenue management tool box. The specific SRM actions will vary across categories and vary across geographies but will impact all four operating segments with benefits starting to hit this fiscal year, and more fully impacting fiscal 2019.",
                 'GM': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.Rocky Gupta - General Motors Co.Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; and Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and a number of other executives.Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.I will now turn the call over to Mary.Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.Thanks, Rocky, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. Our performance in the quarter was strong, demonstrating our determination to deliver strong business results in a dynamic environment, while also focusing on the innovation that will drive our work in the future of mobility.Looking at the numbers, we achieved a net revenue of $35.8 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.8%, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.87 and our return on invested capital adjusted of 25.6%. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $400 million. In the quarter, we capitalized on the high demand in the crossover, luxury and truck segments in addition to record performance by GM Financial.As we continue to strengthen our automotive vehicle business with recently-announced partnership between Honda, GM, GM Cruise to develop and deploy a purpose-built autonomous ride-share vehicle, based on the current rate of iteration, we continue to target commercialization in 2019 in a dense urban environment with safety as our gating metric.Now let's turn to North America, where in the U.S. our go-to-market strategy drove record Q3 average transaction prices. In Q4, we intend to stay disciplined, but we will compete for every sale with our freshest products in years, including our all new full-size pickups.We entered the quarter with lean inventories of our 2018 model year full-size pickups and focused on selling a very strong mix of SUVs, crossovers and midsize pickups with lower incentives. We expect retail sales volumes will increase in Q4 and beyond as we ramp up production of our new pickups.The launch of our new trucks continues to be ahead of schedule and response to our truck-for-every-customer strategy has been positive. Sales of the new high-margin Chevrolet Silverado LTZ and High Country crew-cab models are more than 30% above forecast, and the new GMC Sierra SLT, Denali and AT4 crew-cab models are selling within two weeks.Popularity of our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick and GMC continues as the sales of Traverse, Enclave and Terrain grew in competitive segments.Cadillac's product offensive continued in September with the launch of the all-new XT4 luxury SUV in North America and China. The brand is capitalizing on Chinese consumers' growing preference for luxury vehicles with sales in China up 20% year-to-date. Cadillac is introducing a new model every six months through 2020s, including the upcoming three-row XT6 SUV.Moving to China, where we have more than 20 years of strong market presence, we achieved record third-quarter equity income. This performance results from an improved mix of vehicle sales and a continued focus on cost and productivity improvements. Our earnings have been resilient as we benefit from the growth of important brands like Cadillac and Baojun. As we focus on electrification and launch future vehicle programs, we have opportunities to continue to improve our competitive position.During two visits to China this month, I've had a chance to take a closer look at the macro conditions affecting industry performance. The recent weakness has been more significant in Tier 3 through 5 markets that have less of an impact on our financial performance in the third quarter. Additionally, our growing strength in luxury and premium segments helps offset the impact of the industry weakness.We continue with our plan to introduce 10 new and refreshed models in the second half of the year, including the Cadillac XT4, the Baojun E200 BEV, the Chevrolet Orlando MPV and the Wuling Rong Guang in the third quarter.In addition, in our international operations, we are beginning to realize cost reductions as a result of our restructuring actions in Korea. And in South America, we have managed the effects of foreign exchange headwinds as we continue to drive efficiency into the business and we remain very confident in the strength of our Chevrolet brand there.",
                 'GPC': "Thank you, sir. You may begin.Sid JonesGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company third quarter 2018 conference call to discuss our earnings results and current outlook for the full year. I'm here with Paul Donahue, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call also may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.Now let me turn the call over to Paul.Paul DonahueThank you, Sid, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. We appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2018 results. I will make a few remarks on our overall performance and then cover the highlights across our business. Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our current outlook for the full year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.So we entered the third quarter with positive momentum, having just reported record sales and earnings in the second quarter. Our teams carried this momentum over into the third quarter, producing a strong sales performance, while also improving our total operating margin, earnings and working capital position. This was encouraging as the quarter also presented our teams with a few challenges. The unfortunate passing of Tim Breen, one of our key business leaders, the termination of our proposed merger agreement with Essendant, and the effect of Hurricane Florence all impacted our businesses and our associates in the quarter.Despite these challenges, our team stayed focused and delivered total GPC sales of $4.7 billion, up 15.3% driven by the favorable impact of strategic acquisitions and a 4.3% comp sales increase. This 4.3% comp sales increase has improved from the 3.4% increase we delivered in the second quarter and 2% in the first quarter. It’s also worth noting, our performance this quarter was our strongest comp growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2014.Net income was $220 million and earnings per share was at $1.49, excluding the net impact of transaction and other cost related to the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the recently terminated agreement to spin off the Business Products Group, net of the $12 million termination fee, adjusted net income was $218 million, up 28% and adjusted earnings per share was $1.48, up 29%.We will kick off our business segment overview with our Global Automotive Group. Total Automotive sales were up 23.3% in the third quarter, including a 3% comp sales increase. This has improved from the 2% increase in the second quarter and a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. So we are pleased to see the steadily improving comps, which are driven primarily by our U.S. Automotive results. Our total sales also benefited from acquisitions, net of an unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately 2%.We'll first review our performance for our largest business segment, our U.S. Automotive division. Sales for our U.S. Automotive operations were up 4.9% in the third quarter, with comp sales up 3.2%. This has much improved from the 1.5% comp increase we delivered in the second quarter and the slight increase we reported in Q1. This is also our best U.S. sales comp since the first quarter of 2016. This year's steady improvement in our core sales reflects the ongoing execution of our sales plan as well as the continued strengthening of the underlying sales conditions for the automotive aftermarket in the U.S.The warmer-than-average temperatures for much of the quarter came on the heels of a hot summer and a colder winter, which likely increased parts failure and maintenance and grow the improved demand. Our growth in Q3 was fueled by increased sales to both our retail and commercial customers, and for the first time in two years, sales to the commercial segment outpaced our retail sales. This was driven by the continued strengthening of our NAPA AutoCare sales, which were up 3.4% for the quarter. This is a significant commercial program for NAPA, and we are encouraged by the positive sales trends with these accounts.Looking forward, we believe the improving conditions will drive further commercial growth for both our AutoCare and Major Account customers. And while our Major Account sales lagged the strength of our overall growth in the third quarter, we are optimistic for stronger sales in the quarters ahead.",
                 'GILD': "I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.Thank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.I will now turn the call over to Robin.Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2018.Before I get into the financial results and commercial highlights for the quarter, I'd like to welcome Laura Hamill, who recently joined Gilead as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. We are glad to have this key position filled, and are excited to have Laura on our team. Laura is quickly becoming familiar with our business and has already provided significant commercial expertise on several strategic fronts. You'll hear from Laura in a few minutes followed by John McHutchison with an update on our R&D efforts and then John Milligan with a few closing comments.We had very strong execution in the third quarter, during which our HIV franchise achieved record quarterly sales. HCV revenues continued to be more predictable and in line with our expectations, and further progress was made in cell therapy, including the approval of Yescarta in Europe. Total revenues for the third quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.84. This compares to total revenues of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.27 for the same period last year.Starting with HIV, product sales for the third quarter were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the continued strong uptake of Genvoya and Odefsey, and the rapid adoption of Biktarvy. With 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year prescription growth, our U.S. HIV business continues to reflect strong underlying demand for Descovy-based regimens, which now account for 74% of Gilead's total U.S. HIV prescription volume.Sequentially, U.S. HIV sales were up 5%, reflecting strong demand for Biktarvy. Payer mix in the third quarter was similar to the second quarter, where it was approximately equally split between private pay and government segments. In the second full quarter since its FDA approval in February, Biktarvy generated $375 million in sales in the U.S., becoming the number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients. Biktarvy is on track to overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history, as measured by the first 12 months of product sales. Approximately 85% of Biktarvy's U.S. prescriptions came from switches. Of these switches, approximately one quarter came from regimens containing dolutegravir.Truvada for PrEP continued to grow. We estimate that more than 193,000 individuals were taking Truvada for PrEP as we exited the quarter. Early performance indicators for the HIV prevention and Truvada for PrEP television campaigns launched in the second quarter are encouraging. Since the launch of these campaigns, we've seen active engagement with campaign-related websites and a nearly 50% increase in the number of weekly new subscribers compared to the pre-campaign averages earlier in the year.Turning to Europe, HIV sales were down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the availability of generics in several markets. The decline was partially offset by the continued uptake of our Descovy-based regimens which now comprise approximately 70% of our HIV product revenues in Europe. As anticipated, we saw a sequential decline in sales in the third quarter, primarily due to the additional impact of generics in certain countries and the seasonal impact of holiday schedules in various countries. To date, in some countries, the impact from generics has not been as significant as expected.",
                 'GPN': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President-Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.Winnie Smith - Global Payments, Inc.Good morning and welcome to Global Payments third quarter 2018 conference call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligations to update them.Some of the comments made refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.Thanks, Winnie. We are delighted to report that the strong momentum we saw in the first half of this year continued through the third quarter. We again delivered double-digit organic growth across our markets at the high end of both our expectations and our raised cycle guidance set in March 2018. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points and delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, highlighting ongoing outstanding execution globally.We also made a significant progress in all three components of our growth strategy. First, we expanded our own open software portfolio with the acquisitions of AdvancedMD and SICOM as we continue to successfully deploy our capital to build out our technology capabilities in attractive vertical markets. As a result, our business mix is shifting further toward technology enablement, which we expect to be nearly 45% of our total revenue in 2019, up from 40% in 2017 and 30% in 2015.We are pleased to announce that we recently closed our acquisition of SICOM, a leading worldwide cloud-based, enterprise software provider for the restaurant and food service management vertical markets. SICOM's solutions are highly synergistic with our existing Xenial platform and the two combined provide us with end-to-end offerings for small, medium-sized, and enterprise-level restaurant customers globally, one of the largest vertical markets that we currently serve. More specifically, SICOM adds middle-of-house and back-of-house software and other technology capabilities to Xenial's front-of-house platform.The combination creates a leading solution that includes point-of-sales systems, kitchen and drive-through management, data and analytics, as well as payroll scheduling and procurement capabilities.Our ability to now deliver a complete solution to the entire restaurant vertical uniquely positions us as a one-stop shop for software and payment services for customers in this $4 billion target addressable market or TAM. Through Xenial, we currently provide services to over 25,000 quick-service restaurants in the United States. SICOM adds a worldwide footprint to our QSR markets with enterprise solutions that double our restaurant base across 60-plus countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.The acquisition of SICOM also provides entry into the food service management vertical market, a $2.5 billion account. SICOM is already leading this market by providing solutions for customers like Compass Group and Sodexo. We are very excited about the potential for accelerated growth in this new owned software vertical.We also closed the acquisition of AdvancedMD in early September. We're off to a great start with AMD seeing strong bookings momentum in the most recent period, and we are beginning to leverage Global Payments' corporate capabilities as well as our leading distribution network to penetrate the 80% of AMD's $3 billion payment opportunity we do not capture today.In addition, we see immediate opportunities across payroll and enhanced position referrals from our Heartland business.Finally, ACTIVE achieved record bookings last quarter as it continues to acquire new logos and expand business with existing strategic partners. Including ACTIVE, we have successfully executed three software acquisitions over the last 14 months just as we said we would do.In the aggregate, our own software businesses now have exposure to vertical markets, representing roughly 25% of U.S. GDP, the largest economy in the world.Further, our global pipeline of opportunities to invest in businesses that will enhance our tech-enabled, software-driven payments capabilities remains full. The vertical markets we target are sizable, distinctive, defensible and relatively insulated from disintermediation. These businesses tend to be less susceptible to broad-based macroeconomic concerns and have resilient, predictable and highly recurring revenue characteristics. We remain confident our differentiated approach will enable us to continue to gain market share by widening the competitive gap with our legacy competitors.",
                 'GS': 'Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.Heather Kennedy MinerGood morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today’s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm’s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm’s control. The firm’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm’s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio and stress capital buffer. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that’s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.Today on the call, I’m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez; and our incoming CFO, Stephen Scherr. As Stephen is new to many of you, I’d like to take a moment to introduce him. A 25-year veteran at Goldman Sachs, Stephen has held numerous leadership positions, beginning his career in Investment Banking and then on to Fixed Income, next heading our Financing Group in Investment Banking and later serving as our head of firm-wide strategy. Most recently, he was CEO of GS Bank and ran our Consumer & Commercial Banking Division, including Markets.With that, I’ll pass the call to Stephen.Stephen ScherrThanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. I’d like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Marty to walk through our third quarter results. First, let me begin by saying it’s truly my pleasure to be here today as I take on my new responsibilities as CFO. I’m excited about delivering on the core job itself and getting to know all of you in the weeks and months ahead.I must also say that I’m thrilled to be part of the firm’s new leadership team. David, John and I have worked together for nearly 20 years. We know each other well, see each other as partners in the business and share common objectives and goals for the firm. We jointly recognize the strength and importance of our client franchise, our people and our financial capital, and I’m sure this is of particular importance to you. We intend to take a long-term view to driving strong shareholder returns. This is a key focus area for David and for the rest of the management team. With that said, let me briefly turn to two of our key priorities, which are amongst several areas we will cover in greater detail in the coming months.First, we believe that Goldman Sachs has amongst the strongest client franchises on The Street, with corporations, with governments and institutions and with a growing number of individual clients and customers across the wealth spectrum. But we also know that we can do more to deliver the whole of Goldman Sachs to our clients in a more seamless way. This is a key objective. We’ve already begun to reexamine ways to deepen our client relationships by fostering easier access to all of Goldman Sachs. We also plan to continue to expand our reach to new clients of the firm. We will do so by better leveraging our core competencies of advice, risk management and technology solutions and by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within the firm. Importantly, we remain committed to executing on the revenue growth opportunities we laid out for you about a year ago. I will provide an update on these efforts in November.Second, we are reviewing all of our businesses, front to back, to ensure that our people and our financial resources are optimally deployed. Our objective here is clear: to improve shareholder returns. This is why David, John and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term. We expect to continue this dialogue with you, focusing not only on further defining our business priorities but also on the metrics we will use to measure our progress. As we move ahead, we anticipate that we will have active and ongoing discussions with all of you. David will join our earnings call in January and is looking forward to being a participant in the quarters and years ahead.Finally, I would like to thank Marty for his many contributions to the firm as our CFO. We are fortunate that we will continue to benefit from his leadership in our Securities business. Adding Marty’s deep understanding of technology and the firm’s balance sheet to Ashok’s market expertise and Jim’s thorough knowledge of our client needs gives us the right mix of talent to lead the Securities Division. On a personal note, I’m thankful to Marty for his partnership and guidance in ensuring a smooth transition.With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Marty, who will walk us through third quarter results. Marty?Marty ChavezThank you, Stephen. I’d want to share that I’ve really enjoyed the opportunity to work with all of you, our analysts and our shareholders, during my tenure as CFO. I’m also incredibly excited to take on a new leadership role in the Securities Division where I can serve our clients and further the firm’s leadership in market structure innovation and automation. And I look forward to spending time with the investor community in my new role.',
                 'GWW': "I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.Irene HolmanGood morning. Welcome to Grainger’s Q3 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q3 press release. Both are available on our IR website. D.G. will cover performance for the quarter, and Tom will go deeper into our financials including segment results. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.D. G. MacphersonThank you, Irene. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. So we had another solid quarter. Demand remained very strong in the third quarter and we are continuing to gain share. In the US, as we lapped our August 2017 pricing changes, we are encouraged with our volume growth of 8%, which significantly outpaced the market. We are continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers now that we have removed pricing as a barrier. We continue to grow faster in more profitable parts of the business, notably with our midsize customers. In addition, gross margin when normalized for the revenue recognition accounting change, and operating margin, were both favorable to prior year.In Canada, the execution of our turnaround continues to make progress and is on schedule. We still expect to exit the year at a profitable run rate. Our single channel online businesses, namely, MonotaRO and Zoro, had strong growth and profitability. We recorded a non-cash impairment for Cromwell in the UK, reflecting slower growth than planned at acquisition. The overall international businesses are profitable with the exception of the impairment. We believe that our current exposure to tariffs is well understood and effectively managed. Tom will address tariffs later in the presentation.I would also mention two other things. One, we had a very strong customer satisfaction rating in the US this quarter, actually the strongest we’ve seen under the current methodology. And also with Hurricane Michael making landfall last week, I want to note that all of our people are safe and our team members are doing a great job responding to the event as they always do.With that, let’s take a look at our results. Third quarter 2018 reported results contained restructuring charges of $142 million and a $2.37 impact to EPS. In the quarter, we took a non-cash impairment of $139 million related to our Cromwell business. In 2015, we described to you the expected benefits of the acquisition, based on the strength of the core Cromwell business, the ability to build the online model off of that core and the potential in the UK market. Many of these benefits still exist. However, a few things have changed since the decision. First, Brexit occurred within a year of acquisition and the market slumped. And the uncertainty surrounding Brexit as it gets closer to being executed forces us to take our growth projections lower. Second, the cost of capital is higher now. These two structural issues explain the majority of reduction in valuation.In addition, our strategy included building an online model with the Cromwell name. In reality, this approach created customer conflict with the core business. We adjusted our approach and re-launched the online model under the Zoro name about a year ago. The opportunity with Zoro is large and compelling with very strong early signals in the market. But the late start of Zoro and the lower growth rate given market conditions impacted current valuation. While it’s still early days, we do believe the UK is an attractive place for Grainger to play.This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total company sales in the quarter were up 7%, that included 7% in volume, 1% in price and a headwind due to foreign exchange and hurricane comparisons of 1%. This is the first quarter in 2018 with a foreign exchange headwind. Normalizing for foreign exchange and hurricanes, our sales increased over 8%. Our normalized GP rate was flat to the prior year after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change which we discussed earlier. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all lead to operating earnings growth of 15% in the quarter and an operating margin that was 80 basis points higher than the prior year.",
                 'HAL': 'Lance LoefflerGood morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff MillerThank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. As it played out, it was a challenging quarter for the services industry in North America. We didn’t see the typical growth we expect in pressure pumping activity in the third quarter. This negatively impacted pricing and the efficient use of our equipment as customers responded to budget limitations and off-take capacity bottlenecks.As said, I am pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter. Our team optimized our performance in North America in the face of short term market challenges and the recovery of our international operations continue.Let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue was $6.2 billion essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, while operating income was $716 million a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to the softening North American market.We converted nearly a 110% of operating income into operating cash flow, generating approximately $780 million during the third quarter with over $2.3 billion generated on a year-to-date basis.We continue to deliver the highest returns in the industry this quarter. Now I’m pleased with our international business, which is showing signs of a steady recovery. Our international revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter with growth in every international region.As expected, North America revenue declined as a result of market softness, but we believe we still have the highest margins. Relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance, while our completions related activity remained relatively flat sequentially; we believe we outperformed the market based on available market data. This demonstrates the customer’s flight to quality and positions us well as the market dynamics improve.And finally, we continue our long term focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the third quarter, we returned over $350 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Despite the near term temporary challenges, which I will address in a minute the macro outlook for the oil and gas industry is the strongest it has been in four years. The combination of economic growth, affordable fuel prices and demand for petro chemicals sets the stage for continued positive trends.The focal point of the discussion during this current recovery has mostly been the supply side of the equation. The fact is we have more clarity today regarding the sources of supply and their limitation. Temporary issues affecting North America production, the spare capacity limitations in the Middle East and Russia and significant under investment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. supply are reflected in today’s strong commodity prices.Simply put, current commodity prices incentivize our global customer base to start unlocking more of their assets, and that’s a good thing for Halliburton. We see it in the increased number of final investment decisions announced by our customers and the projected rig count growth.Now turning to near term operations, in North America the market for completion services softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity and pricing and Halliburton was not an exception. The combination off-take capacity constraints and our customers exhausting their budgets led to less demand for completion services than expected.Halliburton’s response was to retain our customers who demonstrate the best efficiency to manage cost, to move equipment to more active operators, to retain our people, to perform additional maintenance and to continue investing in technology.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, current feedback from our customers indicates that budget exhaustion and seasonal issues will predictably impact activity. We think operators will take extended breaks. Some even starting before thanksgiving. Therefore we expect customer activity levels to decrease in the last six weeks of the year.We will do what a rational business would do in this situation. We will work to keep our equipment utilized in the short term when it makes business sense to do so, and we will take steps to position ourselves for a better 2019.',
                 'HBI': "I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. T.C. Robillard. Sir, please go ahead.T.C. Robillard - Hanesbrands, Inc.Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands' quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the third quarter of 2018. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release, updated FAQ document and a replay of this call can be found in the Investors section of our hanes.com website.On the call today, we may make forward-looking statements, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made.Unless otherwise noted, today's references to our consolidated financial results, as well as our 2018 guidance, represent continuing operations and exclude all acquisition, integration, other action-related charges and expenses, as well as the impact from the recent Sears bankruptcy. Additional information, including the reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP performance measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release.With me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Chief Financial Officer. For today' call, Gerald and Barry will provide some brief remarks. And then, we'll open it up to your question.I will now turn the call over to Gerald.Gerald W. Evans Jr. - Hanesbrands, Inc.Thank you, T.C. As we review the highlights of our third quarter results, Barry and I will exclude the impact from the recent Sears bankruptcy, which will allow for a more relevant comparison to our prior guidance and provide increased clarity on the underlying performance of the business.Total company results were in line with our guidance, benefiting from our business diversification. We continue to make progress toward our long-term goals with a fifth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth, improved profit margins, reduced leverage and continued strong sales growth of Champion around the globe.We believe we are poised to deliver full-year results in line with our expectations coming into 2018, based on our fourth quarter view of the continued strong performance in our Activewear and International businesses, combined with the positive underlying consumer trends in our Innerwear business.Revenue in the third quarter experienced greater-than-expected FX pressure, but still met the low end of our range. Organic sales increased over 1% in constant-currency, driven by better-than-expect performance in Champion across both our Activewear and International segments.While we were disappointed that our Innerwear segment had lower-than-expected results, there were a number of positive consumer signals in the quarter that point to improved revenue trends in the fourth quarter.Our gross and operating margins increased over prior year and the strong margin performance drove operating profit and earnings per share to the midpoint of our guidance range.We also generated over $200 million in cash flow from operations, which was used in part to pay down debt, lowering our leverage to 3.8 times on a net-debt-to-EBITDA basis.Touching on our business segments; for the quarter, U.S. Innerwear sales declined 7%, below our outlook for 1% to 2% decline. Our U.S. Innerwear results were particularly frustrating this quarter, as our replenishment orders lagged, despite experiencing some of the strongest point-of-sales results across our categories that we've seen in years. This imbalance between point-of-sale and shipments, particularly within panties and socks, accounted for the vast majority of the sales shortfall relative to our outlook.Within our Basics business, we believe our fundamentals remain strong. Point-of-sale increased in the low to mid-single digit rate, each month during the quarter.Men's underwear revenue grew 5% as innovation drove market share gains and our shipments matched our point-of-sale. And then, in panties and socks, where we saw the majority of the shipment and balance, point-of-sale increased to the mid to high single-digit rates in the quarter.Within Intimates, we're seeing incremental signs that our revitalization plan is gaining traction, albeit at a more uneven pace than we've been anticipating. Our market share is beginning to stabilize after multiple quarters of decline. And point-of-sale trends are rebounding within the key accounts where we have re-launched with new product offerings.",

Adjacent to that link, you can find our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan support materials. Our comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters we have noted in our latest earnings release and filings with the SEC. Harley-Davidson disclaims any obligation to update information in this call.Joining me this morning, are President and CEO Matt Levatich and CFO John Olin. Matt let’s get started.Matt LevatichThanks, Amy and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were in line with our plans, and we delivered the numerous highlights noted in our release including another quarter of improved international retail sales growth and increased year-over-year earnings per share. We are managing our business with resilience in a challenging time in our history; taking stock of our strengths and better leveraging them for a more promising road ahead. Throughout this year, we have been focused on the following: driving demand for a richer mix of products amidst tough U.S. industry conditions yielding year-to-date revenue growth in the face of declining new unit sales; managing our cost structure and shifting how we think and how we work to liberate investment, and focus on the enterprise on value creation; adapting to trade policy burdens on our business, and laying the ground work to revitalize motorcycling in the U.S. and around the globe for generations to come.The unveiling of our More Roads to Harley-Davidson accelerated plan for growth has been very well-received and will be the focus of my remarks this morning. The plan is designed to accelerate our strategy to build the next generation of riders globally by delivering new products, creating broader access, and strengthening our dealers. We intend to drive revenue growth and expand operating margins, and we have challenged ourselves to fund this strategic shift while keeping our current investment & return profile and capital allocation strategy intact through 2022.In our discussions with stakeholders, we are often asked: When will the U.S. industry return to growth? And Why the More Roads plan now? The answer to both questions lies in the fundamentals of our industry and the opportunities to leverage the company’s strengths more aggressively. It is clear there is a fundamental issue with the U.S. industry, and increased ridership is key to returning to growth. Our headline goal to build the next generation of riders is being amplified with our More Roads plan. It addresses the industry challenges today and into the future, while unlocking significant international opportunity for the business and brand. It is a plan for growth and value creation, and it was born from a top to bottom assessment of our business. We have a realistic view of challenges we face and how to unlock opportunities where future growth lies.We have been putting the rider first in all our thinking and all that we do. We see the global consumer needs and interests shifting. We know we must lead the industry with bold actions to change our trajectory and boost the global industry at large. We will better leverage our vast capabilities and competitive firepower, strengths in product development, manufacturing, our brand and our great dealer network. We’re building new capabilities such as a delivering a multi-channel retail experience, leading in electric mobility and engaging urban dwellers and youth more meaningfully.Through More Roads, we plan to strengthen our existing business and enable sustainable growth with the next generation of riders through 2022. It will take time -- it is not a quick-fix. While we have made a promising start, there is much to do; our resolve is ever-increasing. We have established financial and non-financial milestones to hold ourselves accountable to the work we must do to execute our plan, and we will report on our progress along the way.Our stakeholders have also asked us, are you abandoning who you are and your traditional customers? The answer is absolutely not. Our plan is Harley-Davidson through and through, and we maintain our commitment to delivering the products and experiences our customers expect from us. This plan is everything we have ever been, plus more. It’s true that this plan will redefine the existing boundaries of our brand and we’ll reach more customers through new types of products and channels. We’ll secure the legacy of Harley-Davidson freedom for generations to come by executing our plan in a way that honors and rewards our extraordinarily loyal and passionate customer base and reinforces all we stand for as a brand and as a company.',
                 'HRS': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Discussions today will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris SEC filings.A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available.With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you.William M. Brown - Harris Corp.Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first three quarters up 17% on 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow.The highlight again this quarter and for the year is our strong order momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth.Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year.So, let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments noted on slide 4. Communication Systems' revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Night Vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter with revenue up 48% as a focus on readiness continue to drive growth across our services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communication equipment to software-defined radios.The sustained readiness demand has driven a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year.International Tactical revenue was down 12% as expected on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 2017 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of these Australian modernization program in the Asia Pacific region.Strong orders growth of 15% for the quarter and 36% year-to-date has nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect International will be flat to slightly down. As we've been communicating, our tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain International leadership and expand our adjustable market into network systems, ISR and airborne.And we continue to execute well against this strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the omnibus bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY 2018, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY 2018 President's budget request.We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter and, earlier this week, we received an LRIP delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. On the Army two-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon with an award anticipated sometime this summer.For the SOCOM two-channel handheld, we delivered initial test radios during the quarter and will ramp production in the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal 2019. Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leveraged our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade the military communications network. This builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness.And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a five-year $130 million sole-source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link device to provide airborne collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us.",
                 'HIG': "I’d now like to turn the call over to the Head of Investor Relations, Sabra Purtill. Please go ahead.Sabra PurtillThank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Today's webcast covers our third quarter financial results which were released yesterday afternoon. The news release, investor financial supplement, slides and 10-Q for the quarter are all available on our Web site.Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have time for Q&A.Just a few comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information on forward-looking statements provided on this call.Investors should also consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our Web site.Our commentary today includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings and in the news release and financial supplement.Finally, please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without The Hartford's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's Web site for at least one year.I'll now turn the call over to Chris.Chris SwiftGood morning and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a great quarter with excellent financial results and significant progress on our strategic goals. Third quarter core earnings were $1.15 per diluted share, up significantly from $0.35 last year.Year-to-date, The Hartford’s core earnings are $3.55 per share compared with $1.94 in 2017. The higher level of earnings this quarter and for the year were driven by several items, including better underwriting results in property and casualty, increased Group Benefits in Mutual Funds earnings and a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.Let me share some details on these items. P&C underwriting margins, which Doug will cover in more details, improved with a third quarter combined ratio of 97.3 and 95.4 for the nine months. The underlying combined ratio was 93.2 and 91.3, respectively, each better by nearly a point over last year.Group Benefits earnings for the quarter and year-to-date were up 50% and 74%, respectively, due to the acquisition and lower tax rates. Margins remain very strong with the core earnings margin for the first nine months of 6.4%, including the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.Excluding intangibles, the core earnings margin was 7.5% compared with 6.1% last year. And Mutual Funds core earnings were up more than 50% for the quarter and year-to-date with continued growth in assets under management. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew 11% since December 31st and the annualized year-to-date core earnings ROE was 12.7%.Looking at earnings and returns for both the quarter and the year, I’m very pleased with our overall results. This quarter, we made continued progress on important strategic and operational goals. In August, we announced the agreement to acquire The Navigators Group. This acquisition advances several of our key objectives.It enhances our Commercial Lines presence with specialty and E&S capabilities, it broadens and deepens our product offerings with expanded industry verticals and it expands our geographic underwriting reach with an international presence.Leading agents and brokers are demanding deep expertise in comprehensive risk solutions across many industries from their carrier partners. With our expanded platform, particularly in specialty lines and industry verticals for middle market, we will strengthen distribution relationships and improve our access to new business opportunities.A combination of our capabilities and talent with the diverse product offerings and deep expertise of The Navigators team, we’ll accelerate the next stage of our journey as a market leading Commercial Lines company.This acquisition is strategically important to The Hartford. Achieving the financial targets we have set forth will require effort and team work. We are focused on executions and recently kicked off a joint planning process regarding integration. We are excited to work with our future colleagues to develop our go-to-market plans.As previously discussed, we expect to generate core earnings before intangibles of 200 million within four to five years. About half of the increase from Navigators current run rate earnings will come from relatively straightforward investment portfolio and expense actions that will begin to impact earnings in the first year.",

There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today’s press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?Brian GoldnerThank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. The global Hasbro team is effectively working through a disruptive year. Our third quarter results reflect last Toys“R”Us revenues in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific, but also showcase the progress we are making to add a broad array of new retailers to lower retail inventory in major markets and to drive a digital-first orientation around storytelling, innovation and growth across the Blueprint.The US and Canada teams have advanced this strategy the furthest and we are making progress. In the quarter, we recaptured about one-third of the US and Canada Toys“R”Us revenues heading into the holiday and we had orders for more that didn’t get shipped by quarter end. Operating profit in the US and Canada segment was also up in the quarter. While there are a number of factors affecting global markets, including an evolving retail landscape and challenging macroeconomic environments in markets like the UK and Europe, Russia and Brazil, our response to these factors is deliberate and measured to capitalize on our Brand Blueprint strategy with audiences and consumers.Just over one year ago, Toys“R”Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put into motion a process which ultimately resulted in the rapid closing of most of their stores, including all stores in the US, UK and Australia, and transitioning to new owners in select markets. In certain markets, this transition is ongoing. We continue to believe this is a near-term retail disruption that will last for the next few quarters. Our established and differentiated Brand Blueprint strategy has enabled us to transform and we’ve invested in industry-leading brand building capabilities.To best position our company for profitable future growth, we need to continuously drive new ways of competing. We’re becoming a more agile, modern and digitally-driven play an entertainment company. At this pivotal point, it is critical we have the right teams in place with the right capabilities to lead us into the future. As we continue to transform, we took actions which impacted our global organization. We’re focusing our teams on the most profitable, differentiated and strategic areas of our business, while aligning our resources and costs to drive profitable growth.Hasbro is executing robust plans for this holiday season with a broad and growing array of retailers. Following Toys“R”Us liquidation in the US, the third quarter was the first quarter without the retailer and it is clearly visible in point-of-sale at brick retail, which was down globally for Hasbro brands in the low-teens for the quarter and increased slightly through the first nine months of the year.Looking at the US data more closely, where the consumer had direct access to the brands and products they were seeking, Hasbro’s online POS increased high single-digits in the third quarter and increased double-digits over the first nine months of the year. Hasbro has invested to establish a leading presence online. According to One Click Retail, through the first nine months of the year in North America, Hasbro is the market share leader on Amazon in the Toy & Game category.In the US, Toys“R”Us liquidation and stores closings drove an incremental 2.5 million units sold through the first half of this year versus a year ago and impacted the third quarter’s unit sales. However, The NPD Group data indicates that 83% of industry purchases made at Toys“R”Us during the liquidation in the US would be given away by the end of the third quarter.In recent weeks, retailers are activating their share recapture plans for the holiday period. Many retailers set their shelves later in the quarter to begin their holiday efforts. But retailers are stepping up to capture the Toys“R”Us market share. Hasbro's channel strategy has enabled us to open a significant number of new doors at retail. But this also drives new requirements for our US supply chain.We're working with a greater variety of retailers that have differentiated shipping requirements. Our growing retail footprint adds retailers shipping smaller quantities per truck to take product closer to the holidays and require more carton volume than previously, including more cartons of high demand toys and games later in the quarter.In fact, Hasbro shipped more products domestically in September than ever before, and we were unable to meet all the demand within the quarter. As a result, approximately $50 million of US third quarter orders shipped in the first week of the fourth quarter.By mid 2019 we'll add a Midwest warehouse to better meet demand, shorten delivery time and reduce trucking mileage to our retailers’ distribution centers. We're also working closely with our retailers in new innovative ways including sharing warehouse space to dramatically reduce delivery times.While our US retail footprint is growing, our retail inventory declined by 17% versus a year ago. And we have maintained our cost of business across retailers. We have story-led innovative brands and products to successfully support retailers and consumer demand for the 2018 holiday period. And importantly, we expect to return to growth in 2019 and future years.Where the retail disruption has been mitigated and the retail transition moved more quickly, you can see the resilience of our business and our brands. For example, in Canada, where the Toys“R”Us transition has already happened, our revenues and point-of-sale were up for the third quarter. Europe and Asia Pacific are behind both Canada and the US in respect to retailers share recapture and Toys“R”Us ownership transition. ",
                 'HCA': "Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.April, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and also those of you listening to the webcast.With me here this morning our Chairman, CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, CFO.Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future results.On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release. As you heard the call is being recorded and replay will be available later today.With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. Before we go into details about the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael which have recently affected our facilities and colleagues in the Southeast U.S.On September 14, Hurricane Florence made landfall in South Carolina and on October 10 hurricane Michael made landfall in Panama City, Florida. Immediately before and after the storms, we evacuated several hundred patients to other facilities and without patient harm. Both storms had a devastating effect on the communities we serve in Florida and the Carolina's and where our HCA colleagues live and work.Throughout these events, our colleagues in the affected areas and across the enterprise have supported our emergency operations efforts, our patients and each other. Our robust disaster preparedness plans give us confidence when facing weather disasters like this, but it's the teamwork and patient-centered commitment of our HCA Healthcare colleagues that make those plans work so well. I'm very proud of that teamwork and professionalism.Now let me provide some comments on third quarter results. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Consistent with recent results, we saw solid volume and rate growth, increased intensity of service and excellent expense management which resulted in solid adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter.This morning, we also favorably revised our earnings guidance ranges to reflect results for the nine months ending September 30 and expectations for the remainder of the year. More on this later in my comments. Revenues in the third quarter totaled $11.451 billion, up 7.1% from the previous year's third quarter.Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. increased 78% to $759 million or $2.15 per diluted share compared to $426 million or $1.15 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Bill will provide more detail on these items in a moment.Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased to $2.096 billion an 18% increase over the prior year which included the negative impact from both hurricanes in the third quarter of last year and Texas Medicaid waiver payments. Additionally, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA growth rate was unfavorably impacted by an estimated 310 basis points from the sale of Oklahoma University assets.Year-to-date, through September, our adjusted EBITDA totaled $6.441 billion compared to $5.871 billion in the same period of 2017, an increase of 9.7%. Cash flows from operations were very strong, totaling $1.721 billion up from last year's – $1.008 billion last year. We invested $846 million in capital spending in our existing markets, repurchased 2.5 million of our shares at a cost of $302 million and also paid a dividend of $121 million during the third quarter of 2018.",
                 'HCP': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Johns, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Andrew Johns - HCP, Inc.Thank you and welcome to HCP's third quarter financial results conference call. Today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.A discussion of risk and risk factors is included in our press release and detailed in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. In an exhibit of the 8-K we furnished today with theSEC, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. The exhibit is also available on our website at www.hcpi.com.I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Herzog.Thomas M. Herzog - HCP, Inc.Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Pete Scott, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer. Also here and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our Chief Operating Officer; and Troy McHenry, our General Counsel.Let me start by saying, the last two years have been a whirlwind of activity, during which we have fully restructured the company and set forth a clear strategy. The HCP of today is very recognizable from the HCP of just a couple of years ago.Including the announcement of the Shoreline transaction today, we sold, spun or transitioned over $12 billion of non-core assets. We repaid $5.7 billion of debt. We reduced our Brookdale concentration from 35% to 17% of NOI. We expanded our development and redevelopment pipelines. We recruited and installed an entirely new C Suite and we refreshed our board. These actions have resulted in a vastly improved portfolio and balance sheet with a cohesive and energized team.So, let me describe how I see the current state of play, starting with the challenges. First, senior housing new supply has been a headwind for HCP and the entire sector. However, we are confident, senior housing will be a strong business over time within HCP's balanced and diversified portfolio of private pay healthcare real estate.Second, the transitions from Brookdale to new operators have been painful and performance declined significantly prior to the replacement operators assuming control. The reduced occupancy impact will carry forward through at least the first half of 2019.Fortunately, the vast majority of the transitions are complete and we are finally seeing stabilization. We remain confident that in the hands of new and engaged operators, we will recapture a significant upside to this group of communities over time.Finally, this year's capital recycling and redevelopment activities will lean on our 2019 earnings growth as we earn in the dilution from completed sales and experience temporary downtime of properties undergoing redevelopment.Next, what's going well. First, our 82% on-campus medical office portfolio remained consistent and stable. We're also benefiting from our decade-long relationship with HCA through the devolvement program we announced today.Second, our life science business is performing exceptionally well and we continue to see significant demand from growing tenants.Third, our current $800 million development pipeline is on time, on budget, fully funded and already 83% pre-leased. With the strong momentum and strength in the market, we're evaluating the acceleration of certain projects such as the additional phases of The Shore at Sierra Point. In addition to the cash flow and earnings, these projects will produce beginning in 2019 and accelerating in 2020 and 2021, we expect to realize significant NAV creation for our shareholders.We expect to deliver stabilized returns in the 7% to 8% range which compares to the corresponding market cap rates of about 5%.Finally, we took advantage of robust pricing in the market and the like what we believe to be significant value for shareholders by monetizing our Shoreline Technology Center in Mountain View. This transaction will dramatically reduce leverage and position us with BBB+ credit metrics, support our value creating development pipeline, and provide us funding to support approximately $400 million of accretive acquisitions, which we believe will represent $0.02 to $0.03 per share of FFO and FAD accretion once fully invested. As you can tell, we have positive momentum and this is a very exciting time for HCP.With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year. Pete?Peter A. Scott - HCP, Inc.Thanks, Tom. Today I will start with a review of our results for the quarter and update on the balance sheet as a result of the Shoreline Technology transaction and, finally, provide an update to our guidance for the remainder of the year.Starting with our third quarter results, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.44 per share and our portfolio delivered 1.7% year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth, which was in line with our expectation.Let me provide more details around our major segments. For medical office, same-store cash NOI grew 2.3% over the prior year, driven primarily by in-place lease escalators. We continue to see strong tenant demand for medical office buildings. Our retention rate for the year is over 78% and we had a positive rent mark-to-market on our renewals of 4%.",
                 'HP': "It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Dave Wilson - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.Thank you, Wendy, and welcome, everyone, to Helmerich & Payne's conference call and webcast corresponding to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; and Mark Smith, Vice President and CFO. John and Mark will be sharing some comments with us, after which we'll open the call for questions.As usual and as defined by the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.We also will be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation and comments and calculations in yesterday's press release.With that said, I'll now turn the call over to John Lindsay.John W. Lindsay - Helmerich & Payne, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I'm going to begin by welcoming Mark Smith to the H&P team. Today is, of course, his first conference call with H&P. So glad to have you onboard with us, Mark. And again, good morning, everyone.The company achieved several operational highlights during the quarter in the midst of a supercharged market where we continue to see robust demand for additional super-spec FlexRigs and our industry-leading technology. The increase in dayrates speaks to the high value our teams are providing and the strong partnerships we continue to nurture with our customers.There are four areas of discussion I want to focus on this morning. First is the pricing and market share success we've delivered. Our U.S. Land operations benefited from higher activity and pricing as we continue to capitalize on our superior position in the sold-out super-spec market. H&P's leading-edge spot pricing is approaching the mid $20,000 per day range and average stock pricing is nearing $22,000 per day.In addition to our success in obtaining better dayrates in commercial terms, we have also been able to improve market share in both the overall rig count as well as the super-spec fleet where we believe we have approximately 42% market share today. Further, we have leading market share position in the top three most active basins in the U. S.Looking forward and provided that the strong oil price environment persists, we believe we will maintain pricing power and would expect the average spot market pricing to close the gap with today's leading-edge pricing over the next few quarters. I'd like to take this time to give our account managers and our sales and marketing group a lot of credit for their efforts to improve pricing to better reflect the value proposition we provide customers. I want to thank each of you for your efforts.My second area of focus this morning pertains to the super-spec outlook and the metrics that drives super-spec demand. We maintained the leadership position in the super-spec rig market. Throughout the first nine months of the fiscal year, we upgraded 38 FlexRigs to super-spec capacity, bringing the total to 191 super-spec FlexRigs in our U.S. Land fleet.As I mentioned earlier, the market is tight for FlexRigs and we expect this trend to endure as more customers embrace the technologies that drive unconventional drilling economics. On the drilling side, the primary markers for well complexity in U.S. Land are the increased lateral length, multi-well pad drilling and tighter well spacing. The average lateral length today is slightly over 8,000 feet, which is a significant increase from 6,000 feet that we had in 2015.The primary attraction of a super-spec rig are the benefits of the incremental performance capability it delivers and the positive impact that has on the cost and, therefore, the risk and economics of a project. A few of the performance factors include faster rig move time, mud pumping capacity, multi-well pad capability, setback capacity and just an overall more efficient drilling operation.We plan to continue our current upgrade cadence, which has averaged 12 rigs per quarter. If the demand from customers remain strong enough to command a two-year term contract in mid 20s dayrates, we will maintain the cadence.In addition to the Flex3s we have available for upgrade, we have also identified seven FlexRig4s that we can convert to FlexRig3 walking rigs with super-spec capacity at a similar investment to the FlexRig3 upgrade.",
                 'HSIC': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne.Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc.Thank you, Clinicia, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2018 third quarter. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 6, 2018. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up during Q&A to allow as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for this call.With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Carolynne, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results which demonstrate, of course, continued solid growth in each of our business groups. We believe that the end markets we serve are stable, in fact, leading to improving and that we have continued to gain market share with our value-added solutions approach to servicing customers. And we believe that we continue to gain market share in all of our business units.We also are pleased with our progress relative to our long range long-term strategic goals with a balance of organic growth, resulting from our consultative approach and close relationship with our customers, augmented by growth from acquisitions. We have a focus on adding a greater proportion of higher margin products across our businesses and deepening the breadth of our value-added solutions across the globe.We are fulfilling these goals with our investment in higher margin dental specialties and software capabilities which we'll talk about more later in the call and, of course, very pleased to answer specific questions.So we continue to believe we have a healthy business. We are well positioned to take advantage of many opportunities we have for investing in long-term growth of the business. The strategic plan, we believe, is the most solid in all this time in Henry Schein's history. And we are confident that we will continue the track record of good planning, good execution as we enter into our 23rd year as a public company.So at this time, I'll ask Steve to review our financial results and to provide some further guidance on the numbers. And then I'll provide additional commentary on our recent business performance and our accomplishments. So, Steven, please.Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc.Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our Q3 2018 non-GAAP results exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release, which can be found and is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, again you could see Exhibit B in today's earnings release, as well as it's included on the Investor Relations section of our website.So turning to our results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 29, 2018, were $3.3 billion, reflecting a 3.8% increase compared with the third quarter of 2017 with internally generated sales growth in local currencies of 3.2%. When you also exclude the impact of certain products switching from direct sales to agency sales, our normalized internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.1%. You can see the details of our sales growth on Exhibit A of our earnings news release.",
                 'HSY': "This call is scheduled to end at 9:30 AM. Please note that this call may be recorded. Thank you.It's now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Ms. Melissa Poole. You may begin your conference.Melissa A. Poole - The Hershey Co.Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. Michele Buck, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events and those described in these forward-looking statements contained in our 2017 10-K filed with the SEC and today's press release.Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Michele.Michele G. Buck - The Hershey Co.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to take a minute to recognize and thank Patricia. As I'm sure you're aware, Patricia has announced her intention to retire in the spring of 2019. She has been a valued leader as we have: created a more profitable and sustainable international business model; instilled a more disciplined cost management model across the enterprise; and upgraded the company's financial systems, an important piece of our ERP transformation. Patricia and I will continue to work closely together over the next several months as we search for and transition to a new CFO.Overall, I am pleased with the progress we are making against our key strategic focus areas. Our third quarter results were in line with expectations, and we remain on track to achieve the financial targets we shared earlier this year. Our U.S. core confection retail takeaway and share trends are sequentially improving in line with our expectations, driven by strong Halloween results and distribution gains on core items. The addition of Pirate's brands strengthens our brand portfolio and marks our second high growth, high margin acquisition this year to capture incremental snacking occasions.Our International business continues to deliver profitability improvements, while driving strong constant currency organic sales growth. Importantly, we are achieving these results while staying true to our values and purpose, as evidenced by being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year.Constant currency net sales increased 3% in the third quarter, including a net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.5 points. Foreign currency exchange was a 0.7 point headwind. Adjusted earnings per share-diluted of $1.55 increased 20% compared to the third quarter last year.In the U.S., we are focused on executing a strong finish to the Halloween season, both in store and online. From core innovation and occasions programming, to strong sell-in with more than 500 employees volunteering at retail, we are out-performing the category and on track to deliver our first-ever $600 million season.The power of our core brands and breadth of our product lineup enable us to deliver great assortments for trick or treating and Halloween parties. Our focus on optimizing mixes, piece counts and price points has driven strong mid-single-digit growth this year, enabled by some of the core capacity investment and expansion we did earlier in the year. We also have exciting Glow in the Dark packaging on select Hershey's, Reese's and Kit Kat products to add some additional magic to the season. We're seeing great engagement and ideas from consumers on social media for these new products.For those who were able to join us in late August for our digital update, the designed for online assortment bag we featured, made BuzzFeed's top 10 best things to buy on Amazon list earlier this month. If you haven't gotten your candy yet, there is still time.As expected, this Halloween strength and other key initiatives are driving sequentially improved retail takeaway and market share performance on our core confection business. In measured channels for the last 12 weeks ending October 14, Hershey's CMG takeaway increased 0.4% versus the prior year period, resulting in flat market share. In the latest four weeks, Hershey's CMG takeaway grew 2.5%, resulting in a market share gain of 22 basis points, with improvements across classes of trade. This enhanced performance is driven primarily by our chocolate brands, which grew 3.2% in the latest four weeks, resulting in a market share gain of 24 basis points. In addition to Halloween, distribution gains on core SKUs and new campaigns are driving better results.",
                 'HES': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com.Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.John B. Hess - Hess Corp.Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results.We delivered another strong quarter of execution with higher production and guidance and lower unit costs and guidance while keeping capital and exploratory expenditures flat with guidance for the year and generating a profit for the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy to deliver capital-efficient growth in our resources and production, investing in the highest return projects to move down the cost curve and be profitable in a lower price environment, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders.Fundamental to this strategy is our focused high-return portfolio with Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines where we plan to invest about 75% of our capital and exploratory expenditures over the next five years, and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. Pro forma for our asset sales, our high-graded portfolio is on track to deliver capital-efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10% through 2023 while driving cash unit costs down approximately 30% to less than $10 per BOE over the same period. The combination of growth and margin expansion is expected to drive compound annual cash flow growth of approximately 25% through 2023 at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price.An integral part of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to ensure we have the financial capacity to fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our position in Guyana is truly world-class in every respect and transformational for our company. As of June, gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator have grown and are estimated to be more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential.In late August, we announced a ninth oil discovery on the block at the Hammerhead-1 well located approximately 13 miles southwest of the Liza-1 well, proving a new play concept for potential development. This month, a second exploration vessel, the Noble Tom Madden, arrived to accelerate exploration and appraisal activities on the block, starting with the Pluma prospect located 17 miles south of Turbot where we expect to spud in early November.The Liza Phase 1 development which was sanctioned in June of last year is well-advanced with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by early 2020. Phase 2 development with gross production of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is on track for startup by mid-2022. A third phase of development at the Payara Field is expected to have a gross production capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day with first production in 2023. We now see the potential to produce on a gross basis more than 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025 with industry-leading returns and cost metrics.Also key to our strategy is the Bakken where we have a premier acreage position and a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations with a significant infrastructure advantage. During the quarter we continued testing limited entry plug-and-perf completions and higher proppant loadings, and initial results are encouraging. In September we added a sixth rig and we expect to generate capital-efficient production growth of 15% to 20% per year through 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period.",

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today’s earnings release on our website for details.With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio.Antonio NeriThanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We delivered solid results across all key financial metrics. We grew revenues and we significantly expanded operating margins. We also delivered EPS well above our outlook and generated strong cash flow. Our focus on shifting our mix to higher-value growth areas while optimizing our volume business is working. This is supported by excellent execution of HPE Next, our initiative to re-architect the Company from the ground up with a goal of driving better operational efficiency and effectiveness. Even as we focus on new growth areas, we continue to deliver solid performance across each of our business segments. This combined with the market momentum will enable us to deliver fiscal year ‘18 revenue and earnings well above our original outlook provided at securities analyst meeting last year.In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by balanced performance across Hybrid IT, Intelligent Edge and Financial Services with particular strong growth in Intelligent Edge segment.We also continued to strengthen our profitability by focusing on the high-value segments of the market, while improving efficiency through our HPE Next actions. In Q3, we achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 9.6%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. As a result, we delivered strong EPS growth in Q3. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 doubled from a year ago and is well above our outlook range of $0.35 to $0.39. From a free cash flow perspective, we delivered $751 million and are well on track to deliver $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2018.Turning to the business segments. In Hybrid IT, we have the right strategy. And in a healthy IT spend environment, we are executing well, and it is showing up in our results. After a strong first half, we continued to see solid growth with revenue of $6.2 billion, which is up 3% year-over-year or up 5% year-over-year, excluding the tier 1 segment. The operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 10.6% from a greater mix of Gen10, improved pricing and savings from HPE Next. We’re also gaining share in the higher margin, high-growth segments like software-defined infrastructure, high-performance compute and mission-critical systems. In compute, ISS core grew 10% year-over-year due to continued market demand and accelerated mix of Gen10, and better options attach, which helped drive improved average units pricing. This is more than offset in the decline in tier 1 commodity server sales, as we intentionally exit that type of business. Our hyperconverged segment, which now includes appliances, infrastructure and our composable offerings, grew over 130% year-over-year and has reached an annual run rate of more than $1 billion. HPE Synergy delivered record revenue and has more than 1,600 customers.',
                 'HLT': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our third quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter, driven by our resilient business model. Adjusted EBITDA was at the high-end of our guidance range and EPS exceeded expectations. We continue to increase our industry-leading market share premiums and to deliver strong net unit growth, all leading to increasing free cash flow.This setup coupled with a disciplined capital allocation strategy enables us to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned more than 8% of our market cap to shareholders or approximately $1.7 billion in the form of share buybacks and dividends.Turning to third quarter results, system-wide RevPAR grew 2%, driven entirely by rate gains. Broader industry fundamentals remain favorable with solid corporate transient RevPAR up 3% and continued strength in group business.Leisure transient was softer than forecasted, given weather-related disruptions and a meaningful impact from calendar shifts. Accounting for holidays and weather event impacts, we estimate second and third quarter RevPAR trends were essentially steady.For the fourth quarter, we expect fundamentals to remain favorable but comparability issues due to weather impacts to continue to affect RevPAR results. Our updated full-year RevPAR guidance range is 3% to 3.5%.Looking ahead to 2019, positive macro indicators suggest continued strength in lodging demand. This, together with decelerating supply growth in the U.S., should lead to fundamentals remaining positive, with regional GDP growth forecast indicating continued strength in international markets. Additionally, areas of the business, where we have better visibility, further support healthy dynamics going forward.Group position for next year remains up in the mid-to-high single digits, with nearly 70% of group business on the books. And early corporate rate negotiations show healthy year-over-year increases. As a result, we feel good about things heading into 2019 and expect RevPAR trends similar to this year, with growth of 2% to 4%.Our optimism also extends to our development outlook, where we continue to gain share of global activity. We ended the third quarter with more than 2,400 hotels, totaling roughly 371,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increases across both our U.S. and international pipelines. We remain on track to sign a record 110,000 rooms this year and deliver net unit growth of approximately 6.5% in 2018 and again in 2019.Highlighting our commitment to disciplined capital-light expansion across segments and geographies, we announced several notable transactions in the quarter. We expect to nearly double our all-inclusive portfolio over the next several years through our strategic alliance with Playa Hotels & Resorts, including adding two additional all-inclusive resorts by year-end.We also announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria in Miami, which will feature private residences, retail and top restaurants. With Waldorf Astoria now having 30 properties globally, with recently added hotels in Las Vegas and Bangkok, we continue to gain traction among guests and owners alike.Additionally, we converted three properties in Dubai to luxury and full-service brands across our portfolio. This conversion significantly increases our presence in a unique and growing market, while further strengthening our partnership with the Al Habtoor Group.We continuously look for opportunities to broaden our demographic appeal and increase stay occasion among existing guests. With that in mind, yesterday, we launched our newest brand Motto by Hilton. Motto is an affordable brand that combines the best elements of micro hotels and urban lifestyle products. Properties will feature efficiently designed, adaptable rooms, innovative guest solutions and unique F&B offerings, local to each hotel's respective neighborhood.",

Damiris - HollyFrontier Corp.Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter net income attributable to HFC shareholders of $342 million or $1.93 per diluted share. Third quarter results include a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment that decreased pre-tax earnings by $18 million. Excluding this item, net income for the current quarter was $351 million or $1.98 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $202 million or $1.14 per diluted share for the same period last year.Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $613 million, an increase of $159 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. This increase in earnings demonstrates our ability to capitalize on discounted crudes and strong product margins in our Refining segment.Our Lubricants and Specialty Products business reported EBITDA of $42 million driven by consistent Rack Forward sale volumes and margins. Rack Forward EBITDA was $57 million, representing a 13% EBITDA margin. Rack Forward EBITDA is expected to be between $200 million and $220 million for 2018, with an EBITDA margin of 10% to 15% of sales.Rack Back EBITDA was negatively impacted by cyclical weakness in the base oil markets. Global base oil production is at an all-time high as refineries are running at higher utilization rates than previous years. We anticipate pressure on base oil margins to continue next year. We also closed on our previously announced acquisition of Red Giant Oil Company this quarter.Holly Energy Partners reported EBITDA of $87 billion for the third quarter compared to $75 million in the third quarter last year. This growth was driven by the acquisition of the Salt Lake City and Frontier Pipelines, as well as volume growth on HEP's Permian Basin crude gathering system. During the quarter, we announced and paid a dividend of $0.33 per share, totaling $58 million, and repurchased $124 million of our stock.On September 13, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, confirming our ongoing commitment to return excess cash flow to shareholders. For the remainder of 2018, we expect strong diesel demand combined with favorable differentials from Midland to Canadian crudes will continue to support strong earnings in our Refining business.Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on our operation.James M. Stump - HollyFrontier Corp.Thank you, George. For the third quarter, our crude throughput was 442,000 barrels per day, slightly above our guidance of 420,000 barrels per day to 430,000 barrels per day. As mentioned in our last call, we had some operational issues in July with our El Dorado and Cheyenne FCC units that reduced our guidance. These units returned to service in July and the remainder of the quarter saw good operations for our fleet. We also had a successful restart of the Woods Cross units in August.Our consolidated operating cost of $6.05 per throughput barrel was 10% higher versus the $5.51 in the same period last year. In the Rockies, our operating expense of $11.72 per throughput barrel was elevated versus the $9.48 in the same period last year due to the Cheyenne maintenance and Woods Cross repairs.Our Navajo plant ran approximately 110,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, and OpEx per throughput barrel was $4.69, essentially flat versus the $4.62 reported in the same period last year. In the Mid-Con, our operating expense per throughput barrel was $5.07, slightly higher than the $4.63 in the third quarter of last year. Both our El Dorado and Mississauga refineries were down for turnarounds in October, and are both currently in the process of restarting, and will return to normal operations in November. We expect to run between 410,000 barrels per day to 420,000 barrels per day of crude oil for the fourth quarter.",
                 'HOLX': "I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.Thank you, Jessica. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer.We're also joined by our new CFO, Karleen Oberton. Karleen was formerly our chief accounting officer, and we just announced that she's replacing Bob this week. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question and answer session.Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days.Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC.Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We posted strong results overall, with both total revenue and earnings per share finishing above our guidance ranges. Breast Health outperformed, our core international franchises continued to grow at a robust pace, and our molecular diagnostics franchise accelerated from last quarter. In addition, both our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics divisions, which had struggled recently, showed solid sequential improvement, in line with our expectations. And just today, we closed a tuck-in acquisition that will further strengthen and expand our Breast Health franchise. We'll discuss that more in a moment, but first, let me provide an overview of our top-line results.In the third quarter, revenue of $824 million grew 2.2% on a reported basis, or 1.1% in constant currency. Although we're not satisfied with this growth rate, we believe we are making encouraging progress in several areas of the company. Before we discuss that progress, let me point out that like many others, we had a tailwind from the weaker dollar compared to the prior year period. This benefit, however, was less than we forecast three months ago, since the dollar has strengthened since then. In addition, please note that we have now annualized the effects of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, both of which occurred in the second quarter of last year.Now let's get into the details. Breast Health, our biggest business, led the way in the third quarter, as U.S. revenue accelerated while international sales remained strong. Diagnostics improved from a soft second quarter, with upside from the divested blood screening business. Surgical was basically flat on a global basis, and as we predicted, is showing steady improvement over the last three quarters. Cynosure also finished in line with our expectations, declining compared to a tough comp in the prior year period, but increasing sequentially.In terms of geography, our legacy international franchises again demonstrated robust growth in the third quarter. Excluding Cynosure, OUS revenue increased 14.5%. This performance was once again led by Breast Health, but our other businesses also contributed strong growth, reflecting the significant, broad-based improvements we have made in talent and capabilities in recent years.Including OUS sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total international sales were $207.2 million, an increase of 5.5%. On the subject of international, and in response to recent news, let me mention that while China represents only about 3.5% of our total sales, several of our products are included on the expanded list of potential Chinese tariffs. So while we do not think these potential tariffs would have a significant impact on the company, we are keeping a close eye on the situation.In the United States, total revenue of $616.8 million was basically flat in the third quarter, down 30 basis points. Underpinning this, however, we saw positive momentum in our legacy franchises, as growth rates improved sequentially in Breast Health, Diagnostics and Surgical. Cynosure sales declined materially compared to the tough comp in the prior year period, as expected, but increased on a sequential basis, reflecting a strengthening commercial organization in the United States.Now let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results in the third quarter. As mentioned, Breast Health outperformed again in the period. Global Breast Health sales totaled $307.9 million, a robust increase of 7.4%. International continued to lead the way, with sales growth of just over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter, despite annualizing the first of our two European distributor acquisitions. In addition, the much larger U.S. breast business strengthened in the quarter and posted growth of 4.4%, a testament to our team, the strategies they have put in place, and solid commercial execution.",
                 'HD': "Good day and welcome to the Home Depot Q3 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Isabel Janci. Please go ahead, ma'am.Isabel JanciFollowing our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors and as a reminder please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387.Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.Now let me turn the call over to Craig.Craig MenearThank you, Isabel, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our results in the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were up 5.1% from last year to 26.3 billion. Comp sales were up 4.8% from last year and our US comps of positive 5.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.51 in the third quarter.From a geographic perspective sales were strong across the US. All but one of our 19 regions posted positive comps. The exception was our Gulf region, which faced tough compares associated with the anniversary of Hurricane Harvey. Recall that we're lapping almost 300 million of Hurricane related sales from the third quarter of last year.While this quarter brought Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the scope of devastation was more compact from a geographical perspective than what we experienced in prior year. Nonetheless, these storms did inflict significant damage in our community and thoughts and prayers are with them as they begin the recovery efforts. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to all those who are currently being impacted by the deadly fires in California.Internationally, both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps in local currency. As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter. Pro sales once again outpaced DIY sales, but we continue to see a healthy balance in growth from both Pro and DIY customers as they shop across the store. We believe this is a testament to the overall strength of demand in the home improvement market.Our digital business continues to be another source of growth. Online traffic growth was healthy. In third quarter, online sales grew approximately 28% from the third quarter of 2017. Customers continued to respond to ongoing investments and enhancements we're making to drive a frictionless interconnected customer experience. For example, buy online ship to store and buy online pickup in store sales, both grew faster than the overall online sales growth rate for the third quarter.Another key component of the best in class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. As you know, we're in very early stages of a five year investment journey in the One Home Depot supply chain to enable the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. Today, we can reach approximately 95% of the US population in two days or less with parcel shipping.The anticipated end state of the One Home Depot Supply Chain will enable us to reach 90% of the US population with same day or next day delivery capability for an extended SKU offering that includes big and bulky goods. In order to get there, we must invest in a number of different facilities to offer greater depth and breadth of SKU availability.We told you that 2018 will be the year of the pilot as we test and learn with new fulfillment centers. I'm pleased to report that we're on track with our plan and we are live with our first few pilot facilities, with additional pilots scheduled to open throughout the rest of this year and through the next year.As we work on our long-term initiatives, we're also focused on meeting our customers' immediate delivery needs. We've made great progress with our store delivery enhancements as our car and van express delivery offerings now enables same day delivery of store goods. Since rolling out car and van delivery to over 40% of the US population we have seen increased utilization from both our Pro and DIY customers.",
                 'HON': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.Mark MacalusoThanks Derrick. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me here today are our Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude impacts from separation costs related to the spin-off of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses, and U.S. tax legislation except where otherwise noted.This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and provide an update to our full year 2018 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.So with that, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.Darius AdamczykThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.This has been a very exciting quarter for Honeywell. In August we raised our full year earnings outlook by an additional $0.05, the fourth increase in 2018 driven by continued momentum throughout the portfolio. We completed the spin-off of Garrett Motion on October 1, and are in the final stages of completing our second spin of the homes and global distribution business Resideo.We also announced our acquisition of Transnorm, our Europe based supplier of warehouse automation solutions which I'll talk about more in a minute. Most importantly, we continued to deliver on our commitments to shareholders. We met or exceeded our guidance on all metrics. For the third quarter we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.03, up 17% year-over-year driven larger by strong operational performance. We drew organic sales 7%, impressive top line growth across aerospace, safety and productivity solutions and homes.And our long range orders and backlog were up 26% and 17% year-over-year respectively which positions us well for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. Our focus on maintaining our productivity rigor especially in inflationary environment was relentless this quarter. We generated 70 basis point of segment margin expansion, 20 basis points above the high-end of our guidance driven by sales excellence and strong productivity gains enabled by previously funded and executed restructured. We will talk more about the steps we've taken to address the impact of tariffs later in the call.We also continue to see improvements in working capital performance coupled with profitable growth which is driving increased free cash flow conversion. This quarter we generated $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow up 51% year-over-year excluding separation cost. Conversion this quarter was 119%, well above our long-term target. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we've seen and I am confident there's more to come as we enhance our capabilities through the deployment of HOS Gold. We're focused on improving working capital management every level of the organization.Lastly as we've done throughout the year, we continue to exceed our aggressive and disciplined capital deployment strategy committing more than $4.5 billion to share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions through the third quarter. That number includes the dividend paid to date, the Transnorm acquisition and approximately 600 million in share repurchase in the third quarter.The pullback in the stock in the first half of October allowed for traditional repurchases of Honeywell shares into the fourth quarter at attractive levels. And as you saw we increased our dividend by 10% in September which is the ninth double digit increase since 2010.Our end markets continue to be strong, and we have a simpler more focused portfolio following completion of the spins. As I said last quarter, we continue to execute well as evidenced by our sales, margin and the cash performance and with significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. I continue to be encouraged by what I see in each of our businesses and I'm excited for I know it will be a strong finish to 2018.Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent exciting news in our businesses. In aerospace, Gulf Air selected Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency software to reduce fuel costs and lower emissions across its entire 32 aircraft fleet. The software provides Gulf Air a clear analysis in real-time insights that address all flight variables allowing them to unlock savings beyond standard efficiency initiatives. Gulf Air joins a growing list of airlines adopting GoDirect Flight Efficiency software including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Etihad Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines.In home and building technologies, Honeywell Partnered with Dubai Properties to complete the installment of energy savings upgrade in all 11 Business Bay Executive Towers in Dubai. The project includes a fully digital building management system to monitor and control the tower's mechanical and electrical utilities, as well as fan coil units that integrate the software to provide visibility into electricity consumption. We anticipate that project will result in the same use of 3.3 million kWh or approximately $400,000 annually.In Performance Materials and Technologies, Jizzakh Petroleum selected Honeywell UOP technologies for new refinery capable of processing 5 million tons of crude oil per year. UOP will provide licensing and basic engineering design services that allow Jizzakh Petroleum to convert crude oil into high-quality cleanburning Euro 5 motor fuels. This is the 20th award for UOPs diesel hydrotreating technology and the 33rd award for its gasoline and unit cracking technology in last 10 years.",

Please note during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.Jim SneeThank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report our team delivered record sales and earnings in the third quarter. Our company’s long-term growth formula is anchored in building brands, innovation, strategic acquisitions, and achieving balance across our portfolio. We take a consistent, long-term approach to our business decisions and strategy.Over the years, we have increased marketing investments in support of our brands. I am pleased to report those investments are paying off with growth both from established brands such as Spam and Skippy, and with emerging brands such as Natural Choice, Applegate, Jennie-O, Holy Guacamole, and Herdez. We are also delivering innovation to the marketplace at a faster cadence than ever before. Food service innovations such as Bacon 1, Fire Braised Meats, and Austin Blues continues to generate growth. Retail innovations like Skippy, PB Bites, Herdez Guacamole Salsa, and Natural Choice snacks are also making meaningful contributions to our results.Our recent disciplined and strategic acquisitions expand our presence in areas where we are a market leader, such as deli and food service. While it is early, I’m happy to report the Fontanini, Columbus and Ceratti acquisitions are meeting our expectations. The final component of our long term formula is balance. This is why we made the decision last week to divest the Fremont harvest facility, which when complete will decrease our earnings volatility. Our long term strategy is sound and our experienced leadership team is executing this strategy. We achieved record sales and earnings in the third quarter as we managed through foreign trade uncertainty, increased freight costs and commodity market volatility. We generated record earnings per share of $0.39, up 15% from last year. The benefit from tax reform also contributed to our record results. Record third quarter sales were up 7% on a 5% volume increase. The increases were driven by the recent strategic additions of Ceratti, Columbus Craft Meats, and Fontanini, as well as growth from many of our brands across our entire organization. On an organic basis, volume was up 1% while sales were flat. Strength in key brands across our portfolio were offset by lower pork and turkey markets, which drove decreased pricing for the quarter.Third party consumption data continues to show growth across our portfolio in both center store and the perimeter of the store. We are pleased to see growth in household penetration this quarter from emerging brands such as Herdez, Natural Choice, and Jennie-O, and also from established brands such as Spam, Skippy, and Dinty Moore.

                 'HST': "Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.Thanks, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing to the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.comThis morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will discuss our recent transaction, provide an overview of our third quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide further details on our third quarter performance, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.Thank you, Gee, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that once again exceeded our internal expectations on the bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. While top line results were impacted by two hurricanes, we were encouraged that on a comparable hotel RevPAR increase of 1.6%, our operators were able to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 50 basis points.Adjusted EBITDAre increased 7.8% to $344 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 12.1% to $0.37, beating consensus estimates by $18 million and $0.02 respectively. These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels; our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth; and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT.As noted in our press release, we were very active on the capital recycling front in the quarter. This strategic activity followed through on two key initiatives we set early on in my tenure as CEO. Reducing our exposure to New York and exiting our international assets to focus our attention back to the U.S. where we have the greatest scale and competitive advantage.In the quarter, we closed on the previously-announced sale of the W Union Square for $171 million. We also announced that the Westin New York Grand Central is under contract for $300 million, inclusive of the FF&E reserve. The Westin had significant money at risk and we anticipate the sale closing early in 2019.Including the W New York which was sold earlier in the year, by early 2019, we will have sold three assets in New York for a combined EBITDA multiple of 28 times, significantly eliminating our exposure to profitability-challenged hotels in the market.New York is a market that continues to face headwinds due to significant supply increases and continued expense inflation. For reference, since 2007, New York supply has increased by 55% or 43,000 hotel rooms at a compound annual growth rate of over 4%.In the quarter, we also sold the retail, signage and theater condo space at the New York Marriott Marquis for $442 million. In partnership with Vornado, we redeveloped this space beginning in 2012. The sale was at a very attractive price and is another example of our asset managers identifying, implementing and executing on a real estate value creation opportunity.The sale resulted in an EBITDA multiple of 26 times and 19 times on 2018 and 2019 respectively, with substantially all the proceeds used to close out the reverse like-kind exchange structure for the acquisition of the Andaz Maui which we purchased earlier this year. The balance of these proceeds were used to establish a new forward like-kind exchange escrow.Our scale and platform provide us the opportunity to create value from our asset base. And we will continue to identify, evaluate and execute on value enhancement opportunities to drive shareholder value.On the international front, we also sold the JW Marriott Mexico City for $183 million or approximately a 15 times EBITDA multiple on 2018 forecasted results. We held a 52% interest in the hotel in a joint venture with Marriott International. For reference, this was a previously unidentified asset sale we mentioned on our past two earnings calls.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Quarter three was another strong quarter of profitable growth with consistent and balanced performance across businesses and regions. As a company, we’re delivering what we said we would do and optimizing the business to consistently deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth.Q3 was impressive. Specifically, we delivered 12% revenue growth, adding $1.5 billion to the top line, and we increased non-GAAP earnings per share 21% to $0.52. And we delivered $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and returned $900 million to shareholders, bringing the total return of cash to shareholders so far this year to $2.6 billion.Each quarter is an opportunity for us to strike the right balance in how we plan, innovate, and deliver operational performance regardless of market conditions, external factors, and competitor movements. We are continuing to grow in our core with profitable share, advance our position in our growth segments and invest in future categories, where we can disrupt with innovation and new business models.And just as importantly, we’re laser-focused on increasing productivity and taking cost out of the business. As I’ve been clear about, our goal is to consistently deliver on our financial commitments, while executing our strategic framework. We do this by playing our own game and winning the right way and by delivering products and services that are consistently engineered to amaze our partners and customers.Now let me take you through what we’re seeing across the business. First, let’s start with Personal Systems, where profitable growth continues to be our priority. It was another strong quarter with operating profit dollars, margins, and revenue each growing sequentially and versus the prior year.HP continued to outperform the PC market in the second calendar quarter, growing share with broad-based growth across regions and product categories. While we’re proud of these results and the team’s efforts, share gains continued to be an outcome of our innovation for customers and not an objective of our business. We’re delivering differentiated products and experiences to the market. We continue to reinvent our Personal Systems business and portfolio with the most secure and manageable PCs.In May, we unveiled a bold new lineup of premium notebooks, desktops and displays across our Elite and ENVY portfolios, including the world’s smallest business convertible and the first detachable with integrated privacy screen. The team is leveraging HP’s design and engineering leadership to deliver the ultimate combination of style, performance and versatility, what I like to call, our sprinkles of magic.Our premium pipeline remains strong and we’re excited about a range of new products will be hitting the market as we head into the holiday season. Similarly, in vertical markets, we continue to drive innovation and growth. In gaming, we enhanced our OMEN brand with a new portfolio of industry-leading accessories.',
                 'HUM': "I would like to turn the call over to Amy Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.Amy K. Smith - Humana, Inc.Thank you and good morning. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our third quarter 2018 results and our financial outlook for the year.Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts.This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today.Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are all also available on our Investor Relations site. Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Finally, any references to earnings per share or EPS made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.With that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce Broussard.Bruce D. Broussard - Humana, Inc.Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.58 for the third quarter of 2018 and raised our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $14.40, primarily reflecting favorable Medicare Advantage results.Our continued strong performance reflects the advancement of our strategy, which centers on the consumer with quality, convenience and local presence top of mind throughout the organization. Our success is due to the exemplary efforts of our associates and their focus on quality every step of the way. We're fortunate to have a highly engaged team and are encouraged by a recently completed survey indicating that engagement levels of our associates rank as world-class, above the 90 percentile.This engagement reflects a culture of commitment to our values and strategy, diversity of thought and pride in the services we provide our customers. You see it not only in our recently released Star scores including two 5-star contracts in key markets, but also in higher Net Promoter Scores and improved productivity.It was also recently announced that Humana Pharmacy was ranked number one in customer satisfaction for U.S. mail order pharmacies in the J.D. Power 2018, U.S. Pharmacy Study. Ultimately, all these efforts result in deeper member engagement and improved clinical outcomes.While we are proud of our Star scores, we recognize that there is an inherent volatility in their measurements and healthcare is a dynamic environment. Measures may change, and as the industry as a whole improves performance, measure thresholds also rise substantially. Therefore, this requires a relentless focus on quality in both of the member experience and clinical outcomes throughout the organization.To that end, we continue to invest in people, processes and technology to create a more local, personalized and simplified experience, while proactively managing health conditions.Let me give you a few examples. We continue to make progress with Kindred at Home and our efforts already being felt by our members. There are numerous examples of Kindred at Home nurses and our four pilot programs identifying and addressing gaps in care, including addressing non-medical patient concerns that may cause them to forgo the recommended pre or post-acute treatment plan and jeopardize their health. Kindred at Home's direct engagement and information sharing with the health plan further enables our members to make decisions that are best for their personal health and well-being.Similarly, our medication reconciliation program is leading to better clinical outcomes for our members. We implemented and then performed our first medication reconciliation nearly three years ago. In the beginning, it took three months to complete 500 medication reconciliations. We now can do it in three days with the use of technology. We've heard countless stories from our care managers and pharmacists around the impact we're having on members' lives through this program.",

As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had another very good quarter and as we continued to deliver high-quality earnings and expect to carry this momentum through the end of the year. It was also another clean quarter as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items.We reported net income of $378 million and earnings per share of $0.33, increases of 37% and 43%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2017.Return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. We had record revenue of $1.2 billion, which represented a 5% year-over-year increase and maintained strong expense discipline. We're pleased with the resulting efficiency ratio of 55.3%, an improvement of 520 basis points from the year ago quarter.The average total loan increase was strong at 7% versus the third quarter of 2017 and 5% annualized versus the 2018 second quarter. This loan growth was driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in average consumer loans with particular strength in residential mortgage, RV and marine financing and automobile lending. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet with 6% growth in average core deposits.In the third quarter, we increased the quarterly common dividend to $0.14 per share, representing a 27% linked quarter increase and a 75% year-over-year increase. This year marks the eighth consecutive year that we've increased the common dividend. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends, including a higher dividend payout ratio over time. We also repurchased $691 million of common shares or approximately 65% of the total repurchase included in our 2018 CCAR capital plan.As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are among the best in the industry, and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will deliver high performance in the future.The franchise continues to perform well in many fronts, allowing us to make investments in capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. We're focused on driving sustained long-term performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we put in place 8 years ago. And as a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring the top 1,400 officers of the company to comply with hold-to-retirement restrictions on their equity awards.Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a 5-year time horizon in mind, and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, 2 years ahead of original expectations.I've already touched on our record revenues, the continued expense discipline and our third quarter efficiency ratio, which was below the low end of our long-term goal.In addition to our credit metrics -- our credit metrics remain excellent. The third quarter of 2018 was the 17th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through-the-cycle target range and loan provisions in excess of that charge-offs have been taken in 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our 19% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. Now these results demonstrate that our strategies are clearly working and will continue to drive Huntington forward.So let's turn to Slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our 8-state footprint continue to perform well, and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows, and we continue to seek labor shortages throughout our footprint markets. The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018. Of the 4 major regions of the country, the Midwest is the most dynamic region for potential jobs growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics August JOLTS survey. The employment and growth opportunities in Midwest continue to make it a favorable economic region. 6 of our 8 footprint states experienced net population in-migration in 2017. In fact, 2017 was the first year Ohio had net immigration in a quarter of a century. As shown on Slide 70 in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state leading economic indicator indices for our footprint point toward a favorable economic operating environment for the next 6 months.",
                 'HII': "I would now like to turn the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Dwayne BlakeThanks Ira. Good morning.

Mike PettersThanks, Dwayne. And I want to pass along our best wishes to Chris, I hope he feels better, I hope this call will help him feel better. Good morning to everyone else and thanks for joining us. Today we released third quarter 2018 financial results that continue to meet our performance expectations for the business. So let me share some highlights starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Our sales of $2.1 billion for the quarter were 12% higher than the third quarter 2017. Diluted EPS was $5.29 for the quarter, compared to $3.27 last year. We received approximately $2.8 billion in new contract awards during the quarter include full funding for the first two ships of the flight 3D DDG competition. As a results our backlog was approximately $22 billion at the end of the quarter of which approximately $17 billion is funded. The six ship DDG contract represents one of the first awards that will form the foundation to support the business for the next 10 to 15 years on the horizon our CVN 80 and 81, VCS block 5, NSC 10 and 11 and LPD Flight 2. As noted during our first quarter earnings call all of this contracting activity supports our sales outlook for the next five years and is expected to result in the award of base contracts or options to be exercised for 20 to 30 ships by the end of 2020. Turning to capital deployment for a moment during our November 2015 investor day meeting, we committed to investing in the business through CapEx and returning substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through dividend increases of at least 10% annually and share repurchases. Since that time we have made substantial progress in modernizing our shipbuilding facilities at Ingalls in Newport News by investing over $900 million in capital expenditures. In addition, we have increased our dividend in excess of 10% each year and our most recent increase from $0.72 to $0.86 per share announced yesterday continues this commitment. And we have also repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of roughly $1 billion from 2016 through the third quarter of this year. Regarding activities in Washington the President recently signed a minibus appropriations bill for 2019 that included funding for the Department of Defense and other agencies. We’re very encouraged by the support for Navy shipbuilding in the final appropriations measure, which includes the following. Alignment with the National Defense Authorization Act permitting funding for CVN81 under two carrier buy if anticipated savings can be confirmed. Funding for LPD flight 2 advance procurement material for either LPD 31 or for several ships across the future multiyear procurement. Funding to accelerate the purchase of advance procurement material for LHA 9 as well as R&D money to accelerate the purchase of LHA 9 to 2021 and increased funding for the DEG program. We continue to urge lawmakers to proceed expeditiously in finalizing the FY19 appropriations for those agencies that are currently under a continuing resolution. For the 2020 budget request we are hopeful that we can continue to leverage our hard ship building production lines and critical supply chains to affordably achieve fleet requirements address the challenges identified by the administration's recently released report on the industrial base. Now I will provide a few points of interest on our business segments. At Ingalls the team delivered NSC 7 Kimball in September and is striving to complete test and deliver NSE 8 Midget early next year on the DEG program the team completed builder trials on DDG 117, Paul Ignatius last month and is focused on completing exceptions trials in Q4 with delivery expected in the first half of 2019. For DDG 119 Delver D Black, the focus continues on integration and testing to support plan trials and delivery late next year. On LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale continues to perform well on both costs and schedule and a focus for LHA 7EEE is on the test program with trials and delivery expected next year. ",
                 'IDXX': "IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.In reviewing our third quarter 2018 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2017, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits we'll take your additional questions.I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate your joining us for our third quarter earnings call. IDEXX delivered strong revenue and profit gains in Q3, keeping us on track towards our full-year goals. Today, I'll take you through our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full-year 2018. I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2019. Jon will follow with his comments.In terms of highlights for the third quarter, revenues of $545 million grew 11% on a reported basis, net of a 1% foreign exchange growth headwind. Organic revenue gains of 12% continued at a strong pace, driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues supported by 13.5% growth in the U.S.Overall organic revenue growth was slightly below our midpoint projections for the quarter, reflecting moderated growth in international reference lab revenues impacted in part by hot weather conditions in Europe. Operating profit of $117 million increased 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued high organic revenue growth and a 140 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins.EPS was $1.05 per share, an increase of 39% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong operating profit gains and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Reported EPS results also benefited by approximately $0.08 per share from share-based compensation tax benefits that were approximately $0.05 above our expectations for the quarter, reflecting earlier timing of exercises.In terms of our 2018 outlook, we're updating our full-year revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.215 billion based on an outlook for 11.5% to 12% organic revenue gains and updated estimates for FX impacts. In terms of our outlook, we expect to deliver a full-year organic growth trend – growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, in line with our year-to-date trend of 13.2%, supported by continued strong growth trends in the U.S. and an expanding international consumable revenues.We're pulling down the high end of our most recent projected overall organic growth range by 0.5% to reflect expectations for near-term pressures on LPD revenues and tough Q4 comparisons for instrument placements as well as updated expectations for international lab growth, which will constrain the additional CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth acceleration we targeted for the second of this year.We're refining our 2018 EPS guidance to $4.16 to $4.21, or 33% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currently basis, a $0.04 per share increase at midpoint reflecting $0.01 per share increase for operational performance, supported by our expectations for operating margin gains at the high end of our previous guidance range and $0.03 of upside related to higher projections for share-based compensation tax benefits.In terms of our 2019 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion, supported by organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11%, and EPS of $4.61 to $4.75 per share resulting in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 15% to 18%, aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our organic revenue growth outlook reflects expectations for a sustained strong CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5%, in line with 2018 trends adjusted for the approximately 1% in non-recurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard change. Our EPS outlook incorporates $0.03 per share in projected headwinds from FX and expectations for $0.10 to $0.13 per share in lower tax benefits from share-based compensation activity in 2019, which we'll review in more detail on my comments.Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Strong Q3 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $478 million, up 13% organically, reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% in growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement.",
                 'INFO': "I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.Eric BoyerGood morning. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other times. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance. But they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risk and uncertainties.Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit's filings with SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, our Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance? Lance UgglaThank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. Today we'll talk about our strong Q3 results, operational initiatives for sustained growth and profitability, an update on the Ipreo integration and our decision to keep our MarkitSERV business. We had a strong quarter of financial results. The key highlights of the quarter were, revenue of $1.001 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 7% on an organic basis excluding the impact from the prior year biennial BPVC revenue. We continued to deliver broad-based growth across the firm. Adjusted EBITDA of $391 million, up 11% over the prior year, and margin of 39%. Normalized margin expansion was 60 basis points excluding the impact of FX and Ipreo as we continue to streamline our operations and benefit from the natural leverage of the model while continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. And finally, adjusted EPS of $0.58. Let me now provide some highlights. I'll start with Transportation which delivered strong diversified organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter. Growth was driven broadly by the same trends we've been seeing throughout the year. Within automotive, we continue to see strong growth from both our new and used auto businesses and are benefiting from deepening our penetration of existing customers and continued product innovation. As expected, our recall business moderated to a normalized level in the third quarter. Financial Services reported 8% organic growth with broad-based strength. Top performers included pricing indices, valuation services, reg and compliance, analytics, enterprise data management and the MarkitSERV derivatives processing. CMS organic revenue growth was 4% excluding the impact of BPVC, as we continue to benefit from improving end markets and operational changes within our product design, ECR and TMT businesses. Resources organic revenue growth was 5% as our upstream energy business continues to improve and our mid and downstream businesses remain strong. We are particularly pleased to see continued improvement in Resources recurring revenue. We expect the price of oil to end the year higher than the industry originally thought. And we expect the level of CapEx spending to improve in 2019. But on the whole, our customers remained somewhat cautious with spending. On the operational side, coming out of our product deep dive sessions this summer, I'm particularly pleased with the sense of continued urgency and the high level of commercial engagement across the firm. I can report that we are making progress on a number of fronts, which I'll outline. First, an increased focus on being even closer to our customers, a higher level of customer engagement from the top is cascading throughout the organization and helps us better partner with our customers, and provides critical insights that fuel product innovation. Second, our teams are focused on streamlining all internal processes to increase the profitability and to self-fund future growth initiatives. We're using technology to further automate and to increase efficiency in how we create our information and solutions. We are also more effectively utilizing remote intelligence to tap into best cost pools of talent around the world. Third, we have increased targeted investment in product development across our business lines which will seed sustained future growth in the years to come. Let me provide a couple of examples. As we talked about on the Q2 call, we are increasing the level of investments within our upstream business as the industry is starting to spend again, especially on analytical offerings. Within automotive, we are making investments in our CARFAX for Life initiative, our automotiveMastermind led Conquest solution and our cross-automotive dealer network planning solution. ",
                 'ITW': "It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, the floor is yours.Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss third quarter financial results and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.Slide number 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.Turning to slide 3. Today, we're announcing the date and location for ITW's Investor Day. We hope you can join us on Friday, December 7 in New York City, at which time we'll provide updates on our long-term strategy as well as guidance for 2019. If you plan to attend, we ask that you please register on our Investor website.Moving on to slide 4, as a reminder, in the third quarter of 2017, we disclosed an $80 million favorable legal settlement. This table summarizes key financial measures on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis that excludes the legal settlement. Going forward, in our presentation this morning, our comments and variances exclude the legal settlement.I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered a solid quarter with 11% earnings growth and EPS at the high end of our guidance range. We improved operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.6% and increased free cash flow by 17%.In the quarter, pricing actions more than offset material cost inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis and price/cost-related margin percentage dilution showed sequential improvement versus the second quarter.In Q3, we delivered on our earnings commitment with top-tier margins and returns despite more challenging end-market conditions than we anticipated as we headed into the quarter in a few places. North America remained solid with 4% organic growth, while demand in international markets was mixed as auto production in Europe and China and demand levels in several international markets served by our Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids segments softened.Michael will walk you through the details in a few minutes, but at a high level, the pullback in auto production in Europe and China and the softening that we saw in the two segments I mentioned internationally negatively impacted the company's overall organic growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points in Q3 versus what it would have been had demand in those sectors stayed even the second quarter run rates.In addition, and as expected, ongoing Product Line Simplification activities reduced organic growth by 70 basis points in the quarter. Our proprietary business model continues to generate strong free cash flow with 116% conversion in the quarter, supporting our ability to raise our dividend 28% to an annualized $4 a share and repurchased $500 million of our shares in the third quarter.While we expect that near-term market challenges will continue in the fourth quarter, we're narrowing our guidance range and reaffirming the midpoint of our 2018 EPS guidance at $7.60 per share, which represents 15% growth.Our ability to deliver consistent strong results across a wide range of economic and end-market scenarios is a direct reflection of the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio, the strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's focused execution of ITW's long-term strategy.Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter, I'd like to again thank our more than 50,000 ITW colleagues around the world for their efforts in executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day.Michael, over to you?Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.Thanks, Scott. Let's recap some of the highlights on slide 5. Year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter was 11% or 13%, excluding $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation impact. Despite the more challenging end-market conditions in a few places that Scott talked about, we delivered earnings per share of $1.90, at the high end of our guidance range.Organic revenue growth increased a solid 4% in North America, offset by a 1% decline in Europe and a 2% decline in Asia-Pacific. China was down 2% in the quarter, but we remain on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2018 after being up 13% last year. Operating margin was 24.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year and versus the second quarter. I will go into more detail on margin on the next slide.",
                 'ILMN': "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Jacquie Ross. Ma'am, you may begin.Jacquie RossThank you, Michele. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. During the call today, we will review the financial results released after the close of the market and offer commentary on our commercial activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session.

To better understand the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ; we refer you to documents that Illumina files with the Securities and Exchange Commission including Illumina’s most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K.With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.Francis deSouzaThank you, Jacquie. Good afternoon everyone. Illumina had another strong quarter with record revenue of $853 million, up 20% from the third quarter of 2017. We saw continued momentum across both our sequencing and microarray business, including strong demand for sequencing consumables to support research, translational, and clinical applications across a broad range of customers.In the third quarter of 2018, sequencing consumable revenue of $467 million grew 23% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and included about $14 million of stocking associated with Chinese customers buying ahead of potential tariffs.Year-over-year revenue growth of $87 million reflected growth across our high throughput, mid throughput and low throughput categories as Illumina continues to uniquely support the broadest range of customer applications and throughput requirements.Within the high throughput family, HiSeq consumables continued their expected and steady decline as customers transition to NovaSeq. While HiSeq still represents the majority of high throughput consumable revenue today, NovaSeq continues to grow very quickly with S4 representing the largest revenue contributor across the entire high throughput family of flow cells. That said, we continue to see a good mix of demand across the NovaSeq portfolio that also includes a lower output S2 and S1 flow cells.Consumables for our mid throughput sequencing system, NextSeq, continue to perform extremely well with many customers adopting the system as their primary workhorse for NIPT and oncology applications. As a result, NextSeq pull-through per system was at the high end of the $100,000 to $150,000 per year range.And the low throughput family also grew well with pull-through for both MiSeq and MiniSeq within their respective ranges. Sequencing consumable revenue also benefited from a modest contribution associated with iSeq, in its first full quarter of commercial availability.Finally, library prep also contributed to year-over-year growth with our Nextera suite of products leading the way. We believe our continued focus on delivering differentiated solutions that simplify customer workflows and improve data quality and costs will drive growth in library prep revenue. For example, we launched Nextera Flex in Richmond, a few weeks ago, which we believe will a new standard for fast turnaround, time coverage uniformity, and content flexibility for exome sequencing. In total, sequencing consumables represented 55% of revenue in the third quarter consistent with last quarter and up 2% from the same quarter a year ago.Moving to sequencing systems, revenue of $138 million was up 12% sequentially with solid performance within the portfolio. As we expected, this was the strongest quarter of the year so far, and in fact, the highest revenue quarter for sequencing system since the fourth quarter of 2015.Consistent with our expectation for a heavily backend loaded year; NovaSeq delivered its highest revenue contribution of the year with stable ASP trends. Everything we're seeing is consistent with our belief that the NovaSeq upgrade cycle will span multiple years and we continue to target 330 to 350 NovaSeq shipments for the full year.NextSeq shipments grew sequentially and year-over-year with a good mix of existing and new to sequencing customers. Within our low throughput system family both MiSeq and MiniSeq shipments were up sequentially with good activity across all our regions and strong adoption by new to sequencing customers, who again, represented over 50% of shipments in the third quarter.",
                 'IR': "And with that, I would now like to introduce Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac, you may begin.Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand PlcThanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.Please go to slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.With that, please go to slide 3 and I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand PlcThanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today.Please go to slide 3. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our quarterly results and create value for our shareholders.First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow in above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I've outlined.Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins, and free cash flow.And lastly, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term.Moving to slide 4, exiting Q3 and moving into Q4, we continue to execute well and are on track to exceed the guidance we outlined for investors on our Q2 earnings call. First, our end markets remain healthy, and we have continued to deliver excellent growth in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Additionally, our growth continues to be broad-based across virtually all businesses, products, and geographies globally, and services growth continues to be especially strong.Second, our leverage and profitability are improving, as we are effectively managing all elements of the P&L to deliver results. In the third quarter, we achieved our second half 2018 leverage target of approximately 25% through strong volume and effective management of our price versus material cost and productivity versus other inflation metrics. We saw good margin expansion across the business, led by the Industrial segment, and healthy margin expansion in our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses.The second half of the year has become increasingly inflationary since we updated our guidance in July. We are embedding the impacts of additional material and other inflation, tariffs, and the knock-on effects of tariffs in our forecast.In spite of this impact, we expect to continue to effectively manage these costs as we have in the second and third quarters and to maintain our guidance of approximately 25% leverage for the fourth quarter. We have raised our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $5.55 and $5.60, up from approximately $5.50 for fiscal 2018.In October, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion, bringing our total available authorization to approximately $1.9 billion. This reflects continued confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flows going forward and gives us increased capacity as we execute our dynamic capital allocation strategy.2018 is shaping up to be another strong year for us. As we move through the fourth quarter, visibility into 2019 is also improving. Based on virtually everything we're seeing, our major end markets look poised for another year of good growth. Strong bookings in 2018 are also setting us up with a solid backlog picture heading into 2019.And finally, we are managing material and other inflation and tariffs, enabling us to drive solid leverage through the P&L and further expand margins. We expect to use the same processes and tools in our business operating system to manage these risks in 2019.In summary, we're executing our strategy well, and this is enabling us to deliver differentiated performance in 2018. The second half is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we plan to close out the year on a strong note. Looking forward to 2019, we're expecting another good year for our industry and particularly for Ingersoll Rand.Please go to slide number 5. The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong growth across the board, as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were both up double digits. Climate led the way, with organic bookings and revenues of 12% and 10% respectively. Industrial was also robust, with organic bookings and revenues up 7% and 9% respectively. These results reflect continued strong execution of our business strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets.",
                 'INTC': "And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp.Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online.I'm joined by Bob Swan, our Interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and Murthy Renduchintala, Group President of the Technology, Systems Architecture, and Client Group and Chief Engineering Officer. Navin Shenoy and his wife are welcoming a new baby, and as a result he won't be joining us today. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Bob, followed by Q&A.Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings releases, available on intc.com, include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.With that, let me hand it over to Bob.Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp.Thanks, Mark.This summer we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our Data Center, Client Computing, Internet of Things, Memory, and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row.Before we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products, and our people, first our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments, and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage, and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution, and we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company, while at the same time delivering significant operating leverage and exiting non-core businesses.Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand and growth this year continued to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year to date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments.In both our data-centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs, and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence, and 5G communications.We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain.The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They are developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals.As a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full-year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first nine months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, or 112% of free cash flow.We've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After seven years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We focused our investments in the PC sector on the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming, and 2-in-1 segments.",
                 'ICE': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Warren Gardiner - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the theice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay.Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2017 Form 10-K. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, tax rate, organic revenue and EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more effective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent non-GAAP term to GAAP term in the earnings materials and explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful; as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-Q.When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. Also, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President.I'll now turn the call over to Scott.Scott Anthony Hill - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start on slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter performance. ICE's consolidated third quarter net revenues increased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Trading & Clearing net revenues were $558 million, up 7% year-over-year. Data & Listings revenues totaled $642 million, an increase versus last year of 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted operating expenses totaled $521 million for the quarter and adjusted operating margins were 57%.I'll pause here to note that in early October we exercised our option to acquire the remaining minority stake in MERS, which will be the foundation of ICE Mortgage Services. Going forward, ICE Mortgage Services will be reported in operating results and included in our Trading & Clearing segment. With the change, other income will be roughly $6 million lower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. However, we now expect incremental fourth quarter revenue related to ICE Mortgage Services to be in the $17 million to $19 million range with associated expenses of $9 million to $10 million on top of our prior expense guidance.Continuing with the third quarter highlights, our adjusted tax rate was 21% in the quarter reflecting clarifications around U.S. corporate tax reform and other adjustments which drove a year-to-date true-up in our tax provision. Our adjusted year-to-date tax rate is 23% and we expect the fourth quarter adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. All of these factors helped generate adjusted earnings per share of $0.85, an increase of 16% from the third quarter of 2017.Through the first three quarters of 2018, operating cash flows have increased 23% to a record $1.7 billion. We've returned nearly 90% of that cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect to deliver a record $1.7 billion to shareholders during 2018. Finally, please note that this morning we announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization beginning in January of 2019. This new authorization will provide us with capacity for buybacks over the next six quarters, and flexibility to act opportunistically should the need arise. And importantly, we expect to grow the dividend once again in 2019.Now, please turn to slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of our Trading & Clearing business. Trading & Clearing revenue increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. While third quarter volume trends were down versus last year, improvement in our futures and options RPC mitigated that impact. More importantly, open interest continued to trend higher through the third quarter and with one day remaining in October, open interest is tracking up 7% year-over-year and is near its highest level in over five years. This growth has been driven by strength across virtually every asset class.",
                 'IBM': 'Now, I will turn the meeting over to Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma’am, you may begin.Patricia MurphyThank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I’d like to welcome you to our third quarter earnings presentation. I’m here today with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours, and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.I’ll also remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC from the IBM website or from us in Investor Relations.Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You’ll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.So, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.Jim KavanaughThanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us.In the third quarter, we delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, $3.6 billion of operating pretax income and $3.42 of operating earnings per share. And over the last 12 months, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow with realization over 100%. As compared to last year, our revenue was flat at constant currency though down 2% with the impact of the stronger dollar. Gross profit margin was flat, which is the best year-to-year performance in years. The improvement was led by services margin expansion. We expanded our overall operating pretax margin and we grew operating profit and earnings per share.We continue to see strong client demand in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry. And our performance this quarter was driven by the offerings in hybrid cloud, in security, in digital, and in analytics and AI, a testament to our ability to deliver differentiated value to our clients through innovative technologies with the skills and expertise to implement these technologies. We see the results in our strategic imperatives revenue growth of 13% over the last 12 months. We also see this playing out in higher operating margin over the last few quarters, which supports both, our long-term investment and return to shareholders. With our success in these higher value areas and our focus on delivering consistent operational performance, we remain on track to our full-year expectations of earnings per share and free cash flow.Coming into the second half, we said we expected to improve our services revenue trajectory and to expand total services margins for the half. We also said we face some headwinds as we wrap on the new mainframe launch and our strongest software performance in the third quarter of last year.And so now this quarter, we delivered revenue growth and gross margin expansion in both services segments. In global business services, our revenue growth accelerated, driven by consulting as we help clients with their digital transformations. And we grew revenue again in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, driven by hybrid cloud implementations. And I should mention that my revenue comments here and throughout will be based on constant currency.In systems, our IBM Z revenue grew, despite a wrap on new mainframe launch, resulting in what is now the most successful Z program in our history. And then, looking at our software revenue, which spans our segments, we had growth in integration software, driven by offerings that help clients modernize applications and enable hybrid cloud adoption. In solution software, we had good performance in several areas including security, key offerings and analytics like data science, and our Watson health verticals, as we embed AI into more of our offerings. At the same time, we continue to deal with challenges in a few horizontal solution areas and a tougher compare in transaction processing software, both of which impacted overall software revenue growth.Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39.5 billion over the last 12 months. Within that, our cloud revenue is $19 billion, and we exited the third quarter within as-a-service annual run rate of $11.4 billion, which again was up 24%. While that’s already a significant revenue base in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry such as cloud and AI, it’s still early in the adoption of these technologies.For example, it’s estimated that enterprises are only 10% to 20% into their cloud journey, with progress slow by the lack of interoperability across cloud environments and concerns about the ability to manage data privacy and security in multiple cloud environments. And so, clients need a cloud partner that can offer a hybrid cloud for workloads that cut across public, private and traditional, a secure cloud for mission-critical workloads and highly sensitive data and an open cloud to run complex, multi-cloud environments.12 months ago, we launched IBM Cloud Private, which is a starting point for many companies as they embrace a hybrid, multi-cloud strategy. Already, more than 400 global companies have embraced this platform to manage mission-critical business processes in the cloud, and nearly all of these are competitive wins. Just yesterday, we announced a series of innovations that will help clients scale their cloud, AI and cyber security initiatives. These include IBM Multicloud Manager, which is the industry’s first service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We also announced IBM’s AI OpenScale technology, the first open, interoperable AI platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI applications and models. This includes the management of bias, security and provenance of models and data which are the issues clients are facing with scaling AI in the enterprise.',
                 'INCY': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Incyte. Mike, please go ahead.Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter and nine-months 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. I'm joined on the call today by Hervé, Barry, Steven and Dave, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and by Reid, who will join us for the Q&A session.Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2018 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.We'll now begin the call with Hervé.Hervé Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that Incyte continues to perform very well across all aspects of the business. We have recently delivered exciting data at both the EADV Congress and at ESMO, and we are looking forward to seeing many of you at ASH in San Diego. Total product revenue continues to grow nicely, and we recognized a 25% increase in nine months revenue versus the same period last year. Revenues of over $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2018 included over $1 billion in Jakafi sales and over $160 million in royalties from Jakavi and Olumiant, reflecting strong demand for both ruxolitinib and baricitinib on a global basis. It's important to note that Q3 net sales for Jakafi were negatively impacted by inventory moves late in the quarter, and Barry will provide additional details in a few minutes.Patient demand for Jakafi remains strong and slide five provides some historical data charting U.S. patient demand alongside U.S. revenue recognized for Jakafi. Going back to the third quarter of 2012, you can see that Jakafi revenue and the total number of patients taking Jakafi show a fairly consistent rate of growth. Due to the strength in underlying demand and the growing number of patient on Jakafi, we are pleased to be increasing the bottom end of our guidance range so that our guidance for full-year revenue for Jakafi is now a range of $1.37 billion to $1.4 billion.Before I pass the call to Barry for more details on Jakafi performance, I would like to quickly mention recent updates from our portfolio. It's been an exciting few weeks for Incyte, starting with very encouraging data from ruxolitinib cream in patients with atopic dermatitis presented at EADV last month, as well as data from capmatinib and pemigatinib at the ESMO conference last week. On the regulatory front, we were pleased that the FDA accepted the sNDA for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute GVHD for Priority Review and assigned a PDUFA date of February 24 next year.Looking forward, GRAVITAS-301 study of itacitinib in patient with newly diagnosed GVHD is enrolling very well, and both our PD-1 and PI3Kinase-delta programs are on track. We see three baricitinib data in atopic dermatitis also expected in the first half of next year. There is much to be excited about in the coming months.With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry for more details on the sales performance of Jakafi.Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.Thank you, Hervé, and good morning, everyone. Patient demand for Jakafi remains very strong, and we are seeing good uptick in both MF and PV indications.Slide eight shows a robust growth in patient demand for both MF and PV. As you can see, the total number of MF patients currently on Jakafi, shown in blue, continues to rise, and the pool of MF patients on therapy continues to be greater than PV, shown in orange. The total number of PV patients on Jakafi is growing faster than MF, and we continue to expect that in time the number of PV patients taking Jakafi will overtake MF.The sales bridge, provided on the left-hand side of slide nine shows continued demand growth in Q3 and the effect of inventory changes on net sales. We saw an unexpected destocking at several large customers late in the third quarter, leading to a negative inventory effect of approximately $8 million in the quarter. The nine-month sales data shown on the right-hand side of slide nine where effects of changes in inventory are normalized shows a strong 21% growth over the same period last year. The number of new patient starts is typically a leading indicator for sales performance, and Q3 new patient demand data are encouraging and provide us with good momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. Giving our confidence in the full-year outlook today, we have adjusted Jakafi guidance by lifting the lower end of the prior guidance range.",
                 'IP': "It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation to those figures is available on our website.Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and the Graphic Packaging investments, slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered very strong performance in the third quarter with more than 50% earnings growth year-over-year and building on our solid performance in the first half of the year. We expect the momentum in our businesses to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.Coming back to the third quarter, we had solid commercial performance and continued price realization across our three businesses. And, overall, we see continued healthy demand for our products globally. We are facing cost headwinds from distribution and most of our inputs, but again we see this as a reflection of the strong economy that we're operating in and the healthy underlying demand for our products. Our operations performed well in a lighter planned maintenance outage quarter and our teams managed extremely well through Hurricane Florence.Tim will cover the financial impact of Hurricane Florence in more detail. But, first, I want to thank the employees in our company who were impacted by the historic storm for their commitment to prepare, recover and restart our facilities safely and clearly in the face of their own personal hardship. I'm also very proud of the response by the IP family. IP and our Employee Relief Fund provided $1.8 million in emergency funds at the time it was needed to more than 1,200 employees to assist them with the basic needs in the aftermath of the storm. I think this is a great example of what we call The o – doing the right things and the right ways for the right reasons all of the time.Turning to the financial results on slide 4, revenue increased by more than 7% year-over-year on solid commercial performance and continued healthy demand. EBITDA improved by nearly 18% year-over-year with very strong margin expansion across our three businesses.Our North American Industrial Packaging business performed very well. We are ahead of the industry volume growth in the third quarter, driven by our focus on segments that are benefiting from strong secular growth trendOur Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered record fluff pulp shipments in the third quarter despite the impact of Hurricane Florence, and our Papers business delivered very strong results globally with outstanding commercial and operational performance. Our equity earnings in the quarter were $92 million dollars, which includes $74 million from our Ilim joint venture and $19 million from our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging.Free cash flow accelerated in the third quarter on very strong cash from operations and lower CapEx versus the second quarter as we expected. All in, the company delivered a very strong performance and we managed it extremely well through the hurricane.I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our three businesses as well as our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. I'm on slide 5 which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Operating earnings improved $0.37 sequentially, driven by strong commercial performance and lower planned maintenance outage expense. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by $36 million related to Hurricane Florence. During the quarter, we also had a favorable one-time true-up of $24 million across all businesses that will not repeat in the fourth quarter. This was mainly related to lower health and medical benefit cost.And in operations and cost, we also had higher expenses related to the Madrid mill start-up. Input costs and distribution were unfavorable, with higher costs sequentially across most inputs. The distribution environment remains very tight and our businesses continue to work aggressively to mitigate the impact. Corporate expense and taxes were favorable with a 24% effective tax rate driven by discrete tax benefits in the quarter.",
                 'IPG': "I would now like to turn over the call to Mr. Jerry Leshne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Jerry LeshneGood morning. Thank you for joining us. We have posted our earnings release and our slide presentation on our website, interpublic.com. This morning, we are joined by Michael Roth and Frank Mergenthaler. We will begin with prepared remarks to be followed by Q&A. We plan to conclude before market open at 9:30 Eastern.During this call, we will refer to Forward-Looking Statements about our Company. These are subject to the uncertainties in the cautionary statement that is included in our earnings release and the slide presentation and further detailed in our 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Michael Roth.Michael RothThank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we review our third quarter and year-to-date results. I'll start by covering highlights of our performance, Frank will then provide additional detail and I'll conclude with an update on our agencies to be followed by our Q&A.We are pleased to again report strong financial performance. Third quarter net revenue organic growth was 5.4%. Our adjusted operating income increased 7% to $273 million adjusted for one time transaction expenses from our acquisition of Acxiom. Operating margins similarly adjusted expanded 50 basis points from a year results to 14.4%.The quarter reflects our continued growth in every major world region. U.S. organic growth was 5% while international growth was 6% highlighted by strong increases across LatAm, Asia PAC, Europe and the UK. We also continue to drive growth across all of our major service disciplines led by notably strong performance in media, and increases in advertising, public relations and at our digital specialist agencies. Extensive list of contributing agencies is headed up by Mediabrands, FCB, McCann World group, Huge, R/GA, Weber Shandwick, Golin, MullenLowe and Octagon.In terms of client sectors in the quarter. Our growth was phased by healthcare, tech and telecom, financial services and consumer goods. We saw both existing client increases from a year ago and the benefit of net new business wins. Through nine-months organic growth was 4.9% a strong year-to-date results that again was driven by increases in every major world region and discipline.Growth at these levels continues to underscore the distinctive talents of our people and the strength of our agency brands as well as the differentiated structure of our Company. Our approach to highly strategic areas such as our expanding capabilities in data and analytics and our ability to create seamless open architecture solutions across our agencies has been consistently validated in our results. These are competitive strengths that drive business results for clients and sustain the growth leadership that you are seeing from us once again today.Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.41 as reported and was $0.48 as adjusted for transaction expenses for our acquisition of Acxiom and for business dispositions in the quarter. That compares with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.37 a year ago, an increase of 30%. The nine-month period diluted EPS was $0.75 and with $0.93 as adjusted.Turning to our outlook for the full-year, you will recall that we came into 2018 with financial targets of 2% to 3% organic growth and 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion. We raised our sites in April to the high-end of the growth range and raised it again following our strong second quarter to 4% and 4.5% for the full-year.Through nine-months we are confident that performance to date in the current tone of business have us on track to meet or exceed this higher revenue growth range. Along with that, we have also increased our investment in the talent and tools to support current and future growth, while continuing to drive towards our target of 60 to 70 basis points of net revenue margin expansion, excluding one-time deal cost.As you know the quarter was highlighted not only by strong performance, but also by the steps we took to further strengthen our offerings and expand our Companies industry leadership going forward. The quarter began with our announcement that we would acquire Acxiom marketing solutions and concluded with our well-received transaction financing in the debt capital markets followed by our acquisition closing on October 1.Acxiom is a world class data asset, there are many opportunities between our companies which we will discuss later, but it's important to note that with ownership we get Acxiom’s first part of data management business as all companies look to make their first party data work harder for them and do so in an increasingly regulated and secure environment, Acxiom is considered a premier provider of these service.",
                 'IFF': "I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2018 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 27, 2018 and our press release that we filed yesterday.Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release and is on our website.With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.Thank you, Mike. On the call today, we will review our financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months for 2018, give a quick update on Frutarom since the transaction has closed, and provide an update to all financial expectations for the full year, inclusive of Frutarom. Then we will be happy to take any questions that you may have.Starting with a recap of our first nine months performance, growth was strong across our key financial metrics. Currency neutral sales increase 6% year-to-date, with Flavors growing 6% and Fragrances growing 5%. New win performance and price increases to mitigate rising material cost, both contributed to consolidated growth.From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 4%, supported by volume leverage and our focus to drive greater efficiency throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives.Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 11%, driven by adjusted operating profit growth as well as a more favorable effective tax rate. Our strategic priorities continue to drive overall performance over the first nine months of 2018. Sales of our Re-Imagine Modulation portfolio grew strong double-digit and PowderPure grew an impressive triple-digits, both indicative of our position as a leader in innovation.Performance with local and regional customers remained strong, growing double that of our global customers, which on a consolidated basis is about 50% of our customer base. In Flavor specifically, our mid-size go-to-market platform, Tastepoint, continued to deliver strong results, improving strong double-digits in the first nine months of 2018. In terms of maximizing our portfolio towards our most margin accretive categories, cosmetic active ingredients continued its robust growth trend by improving double-digits. Also on the Fragrance side, hair care grew double-digits and home care and toiletries improved high-single digits. In Flavors, growth was strong in dairy and beverage, improving double-digits and high-single digits respectively.We also continue to focus on driving greater efficiencies throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives, which allows us to reallocate resources to efforts that drive the greatest returns and maintain strong profitability. This yielded strong results in the first nine months of 2018. And so our cost and productivity initiatives, including zero-based budgeting added approximately 5 percentage points of gross to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with how well our refreshed priorities are performing and believe better positions us to drive long-term value for our shareholders.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich.[07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]Thanks, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone.Moving on to our Q3 performance, currency neutral sales in the second quarter grew 4%. Growth was led by new wins and price increases to mitigate the impact of raw material cost inflation. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit increased 3% in the third quarter, as top line growth and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives was offset by unfavorable price to input costs, inclusive of the BASF citral issue and weaker sales mix. Pricing was up more than 2 percentage points in the quarter on a consolidated basis.",
                 'INTU': 'With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit’s Vice President of Finance and Treasurer.Jerry NatoliThanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit’s third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit’s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit’s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today’s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.With that, I will turn the call over to Brad.Brad SmithThanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. We delivered very strong results in our third fiscal quarter, with overall revenue growth of 15%, fueled by 15% growth in the Consumer Group and 16% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Because of this strength and the continued momentum across the company, we are raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2018. With that headline, let me share some observations on our business overall and I will start with tax and our consumer business. Heading into tax season, we foreshadowed that this year’s primary drivers of revenue would be do-it-yourself category growth and higher average revenue per return. That’s indeed how the season played out, producing very strong results.As we have communicated over the years, there are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS and the latest IRS data indicates total returns grew about 1% in line with our expectations. The second is the percentage of those returns that were filed using do-it-yourself software. As a reminder, the DIY category growth is our largest lever of revenue growth. To-date, the DIY category share has grown just over 0.5 point, again outpacing the assisted tax prep category. As the leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth. So, we are pleased with this result. The third is our share within DIY. We competed well and earned a modest increase in our share of the category this season. When you look beyond DIY to total returns, we also gained 0.5 point of total market share. The fourth is the average revenue per return, which increased quite nicely this season. The growth was driven by a combination of attach, mix shift to the higher end of our product line, which includes TurboTax Live and pricing for value. Bottom line, it was a successful tax season.As we shared at Investor Day last fall, in addition to extending our lead in DIY, we are increasingly focused on transforming assisted tax prep and expanding our business beyond tax. We made encouraging progress behind each of these strategic priorities this season. In support of transforming assisted tax prep, we are pleased with the results of our TurboTax Live offering in its first season. We delivered an innovative experience that enabled filers who are seeking more confidence in their personal tax situation to do so by accessing a tax pro with the touch of a screen. Feedback from the nearly 2,000 pros and the many customers they served reinforced our confidence that TurboTax Live has the potential to be transformative to our consumer business in the years to come. It opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category and it provides us with an opportunity to grow our dollar share while increasing our average revenue per return. Michelle will share some additional data around our progress in a moment.This season was also the first for our Turbo offering, the consumer financial platform that expands our portfolio beyond tax. Turbo provides customers with a full view of their overall financial health by combining their credit score, verified income data, and a debt-to-income ratio to show customers where they truly stand. This year, TurboTax customers had the option to transfer their tax data into a Turbo account when they completed their return. Nearly 5 million TurboTax customers registered for Turbo in year one, providing us with a strong foundation to extend our business beyond today’s user paid model. The real value of this offering will come as customers engage with it on an ongoing basis.Overall, we feel good about our results this tax season and I want to congratulate all the employees throughout the company who played a role in delivering that performance. We are just getting started with TurboTax Live and we are looking forward to what we can deliver next season. Shifting to the Strategic Partner Group, our professional tax revenue was in line with our expectations for the quarter, with revenue up 4% year-to-date. We continue to focus on multi-service accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This enables us to drive our accountants’ success while growing our small business ecosystem at the same time.',
                 'ISRG': "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Financial Investor Relation, Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.Calvin DarlingThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive Surgical's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today, we have Gary Guthart, our President and CEO and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 02, 2018 and 10-Q filed on July 20, 2018. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's EDGAR database. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on the Latest Events section, under our Investor Relations page. In addition, today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website.Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our third quarter results as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights. Marshall will provide a review of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss procedures and clinical highlights, and provide our updated financial outlook for 2018. And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.Gary GuthartGood afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. The third quarter of 2018 was a strong one for Intuitive with continued clinical adoption of our products and positive steps in product launches. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe acceptance of da Vinci in general surgery in the United States, growth internationally and appreciation of our generation-four platform underpins our recent performance. Our team introduced sophisticated new products into the market this quarter as we seek to advance our goals of improving the quality of surgery and decreasing its variability.Global procedure growth was approximately 20% in the third quarter of 2018, compared with the third quarter of 2017, increasing modestly from our Q2 growth rate. Trends present in the first half of the year have continued with the United States showing particular strength in hernia repair, colorectal procedures, and practice related general surgery procedures, including cholecystectomy.Mature procedure growth in the United States, including prostatectomy and hysterectomy was solid again in the quarter. In Japan, procedures grew above 40% year-over-year, while our team is onboarding customer-facing staff and optimizing training logistics to support market growth. European procedure performance was generally in line with our expectations again this quarter with particular strength in the UK. Calvin will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call.Our capital placement performance in the third quarter was strong with growth in total placements over Q3 of 2017 rising 37% from 169 to 231 this quarter. Net of trade-ins and retirements, our da Vinci installed base grew 13% over Q3 2017. The mix of system placements between our flagship Xi System and our value X System aligned with our strategy regionally. Capital placements have been historically lumpy and we anticipate variability in placements going forward.As we indicated on prior calls, we are seeing increased customer interest in alternative capital acquisition approaches, including leasing and usage-based models. This quarter, the proportion of new systems placed under lease increased over prior quarters. We believe it is in both our customer's interest and Intuitive’s to offer alternative financing models for qualified hospitals. We have expanded these programs accordingly.On the investment front, we are building our organization and making investments to deepen both our technological and regional capabilities. Fixed cost spending in the quarter was slightly lower than we planned, largely due to timing issues that we anticipate will catch up in future quarters. Use of our products has increased over the past year and we are in the early stages of several important product launches. Speaking directionally, we are investing to drive technology strength and to build operating and supply capability in support of our future growth.Financial highlights for our third quarter results were as follows; revenue for the quarter was $921 million, up 14%. Pro forma gross profit margin was 71.5% compared to 71.8% in the third quarter last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $486 million, up 21%.",
                 'IVZ': "And welcome to Invesco's Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.Martin FlanaganThank you and thank you everybody for joining us and I appreciate you changing your schedule so quickly. Some very, very good news, we're going to talk about the transaction between ourselves Oppenheimer and MassMutual and also go over the third quarter results and if you're so inclined the presentations on our website if you want to follow along. [indiscernible] has been quite a bit of news in the market about this combination for a period of time, but before we get into the third quarter results, I really want to clarify some very important key points.The combination will result in Invesco being the thirteenth largest global asset manager in the world and the sixth largest manager in the US retail channel, both are very important when you think of the importance of scale and client relevance as we look forward. The financial returns are extraordinarily compelling. For the partial year 2019, we're expecting 18% accretion, in the full year 2020 27% accretion and post synergies we anticipate an additional billion dollars of cash flow for the combined company, so really quite extraordinary.We're also very excited that MassMutual can be a long time strategic shareholder of 15.5% equity stake in the $4 billion of preferred, but Loren get into details in a few minutes, but what's really important, MassMutual is not selling or taking every dollar, all the proceeds to the backing of the combined institution, showing their commitment and the excitement for the opportunity in front of us. And the other point I want to make, we're going to initiate today a $1.2 billion stock buyback which is also an important part of the discussion that we'll be having today.So with that Loren, you can talk through the financials, yeah.Loren StarrYeah, thank you very much Marty. So on Slide 7 you'll see a summary of the results for the third quarter and continued to demonstrate strong long-term investment performance with 63% and 67% actively managed assets in the top half of peers over the three and five years.Our year-to-date gross sales are up 16.7% versus prior year, market dynamics and some near-term performance challenges continue to impact redemption leading to total long-term net outflows of 11.2 billion for the quarter.Adjusted net operating income was 358 million for the quarter, that was down from 377 million in the prior quarter and that was driven by a lower revenue yield resulting from a change in AUM mix, the negative impact of foreign exchange and the impact of lower transaction fees within other revenues.Additionally, on expense side, we saw some elevated marketing and technology expenses this quarter. These items are also impacted our adjusted operating margin, which decreased to 37% from 38.7% in the prior quarter.We returned 124 million to shareholders during the quarter two dividends and we've made good progress in paying down the balance on our credit revolver in early October and we expect to have our leverage ratios buffer in line with our previous Guggenheim acquisition levels by the end of the fourth quarter.Moving on to slide eight, we highlight more in terms of investment performance for the quarter over the one, three and five years. As we've noted in past conversations, our investment processes and approach are focused on generating our performance over a full market cycle, so we typically see fluctuations between quarters.The current market cycle is impacting the relative performance of a number of large value-based equity investment approaches representing more than 10% of included AUM, but some of their recent market volatility and more favourable market condition, however, the teams have seen near term improvement as you would expect. As an example, diversified dividend is now in the top debt file [ph] on a quarter-to-date basis, and also our UK equity portfolios and international growth portfolios are in the top quartile.Let's turn to flows on slide 8. As I noted, while gross sales have been robust for the quarter up more than 17% on a year-to-date basis for 2017, we did see net negative flows during the third quarter as market dynamics weighed on redemptions and the net results.With a pockets of strength within ETFs with nearly 1.5 billion of employees in US ETFs and that included nearly a 0.5 billion of flows into our bullet share franchise winning new flows in these products based closed to nearly 1 billion. Commodity ETFs in Europe and then commodity ETFs in U.S. were weaker in line with industry trends, which led to modestly negative path for the ETF flows for the quarter.On the active side, the outflows were largest in the U.S., the U.K. retail equity products, which continue to face some of the challenges as noted earlier. Additionally, on the institutional side, we saw a two sovereign wealth fund up close with total nearly 2.5 billion.",
                 'IPGP': "Good morning and welcome to IPG Photonics' Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast.James F. Hillier - IPG Photonics Corp.Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements.These risks and uncertainties include those detailed in IPG Photonics' Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2017, and other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings may be obtained by visiting the Investors' section of IPG's website or by contacting the company directly.

Company assumes no obligation to publicly release any updates or revisions to any such statements. For additional details on our reported results, please refer to the earnings press release and Excel-based financial data workbook posted to our Investor Relations website. We will post these prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website following the completion of the call.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Valentin.Valentin P. Gapontsev, Ph.D. - IPG Photonics Corp.Good morning, everyone. Q3 was a challenging quarter as macroeconomic and geopolitical factors reduced demand for our laser products. Despite these challenges, IPG made important progress driving higher power solutions into the market and generating meaningful traction selling our newest product and solutions. We believe our progress in high power and new products will help us emerge from the current downturn in a stronger competitive position with greater opportunities to address the growing market for laser solutions.As noted in our preliminary earnings release, we believe tariffs and trade-related headwinds were the primary driver of weaker than expected performance for our business in China and Europe, where China is the main market for perfect European metal processing machines. Indication from our customers suggest that the purchases of laser system in these regions are being pushed out. We believe uncertainty resulting from the ongoing US-China trade conflict is reducing overall demand for industrial capital equipment purchases, predominantly in China.In addition, we believe the softening macroeconomic climate in China and Europe, as indicated by lower manufacturing PMI and reduced levels of infrastructure investment, is affecting near-term demand for laser systems. However, we remain confident in the longer term secular growth of fiber laser technology over other lasers and non-laser tools. During prior business downturns, we have seen customers begin to increase investment in transformational automation and miniaturization technologies that include our laser solutions in order to improve productivity and launch new products.We continue to expect our solutions to gain share from traditional tools and process technologies due to the superior productivity, flexibility, precision and power of fiber laser systems. We remain the clear market leader in fiber laser technology. That said, competition in continuous wave laser products at less than 4 kilowatts has increased. Some competitors have also announced continuous wave lasers with power output of up to 10 kilowatts.China remains our largest and most competitive market (00:05:14). As we have previously indicated, we are seeing very aggressive pricing for select products by our competitors in China. However, we believe our advanced technology, scale and cost advantage over the competition are enabling us to win in the market despite these pricing actions. As our response to the new market situation, during the third quarter we introduced new ultra-compact 1 to 3 kilowatt lasers and other products designed specifically for the market in China.With the benefit of additional production capacity and these new solutions, we were able to sell several hundred more high-power lasers to OEMs in China that were either exclusively or predominantly buying lasers from our competition. We have won new business in part because some of these customers have expressed fast-growing concern and frustration with the performance and reliability of competitor products.The revenue impact from these gains has been limited by macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, but these early efforts are yielding positive results. As a reminder, we believe there is no company that can deliver high-power laser solution at our quality, scale, cost and lead time. We continue to drive market acceptance of our ultra-high power fiber laser technology at 6 kilowatts and above, which is now approaching 50% of our high-power laser sales. We continue to see our largest OEM customers migrating to higher power fiber laser cutting solutions, and Q3 was a record quarter for sales of our unique 12 and 15 kilowatt lasers.",
                 'IQV': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Andrew MarkwickThank you, Jenifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with Company’s business, including the impact of the changes to the revenue recognition accounting standards which is discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.Ari BousbibThanks, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings call.I’m pleased to report that Q3 was another quarter of strong financial performance. And once again, we report results at the high end or above our guidance ranges. To review the numbers, our third quarter revenue of $2,594 million came in at the high end of our guidance range and thus despite the headwinds from FX of approximately $10 million. Revenue growth was 6.3% at constant currency.Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was strong despite the traditional Q3 demand softness on the commercial side of the business. Constant currency Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth was 15% in the third quarter. And again consistent with the first and second quarter, organic constant currency growth was about 4%. I think actually year-to-date constant currency organic growth rate on Technology & Analytics Solutions was over 4%.R&D Solutions revenue grew 3.5% at constant currency. Early in the third quarter, we marked the anniversary of all acquired R&D businesses, and therefore, this growth is organic. As you know, we experienced some quarterly lumpiness associated with the timing of revenue recognition and pass-through under ASC 606. In fact, pass-through this quarter crossed several hundred basis points of R&D growth.As expected, third quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions growth was down about 12% at constant currency.Switching to profit. Adjusted EBITDA of $561 million was above our guidance range, and it grew 8.4% at constant currency. Third quarter adjusted income margin expanded 80 basis points reported and 40 basis points at constant currency, reflecting the continued impact of our synergy realization and cost-containment initiatives.Let’s look a bit at our year-to-date margin expansion. Year-to-date revenue conversion contributed a 120 basis points of margin expansion and all cost take out actions contributed a 140 basis points of margin expansion. As you know, we’ve been making investments in our technology suite, technology acquisitions, our next generation of clinical development offering, and the expansion of our real-world platform. All of these initiatives have a diluted impact on our margins. These items, all net to 70 basis points of year-to-date margin expansion at current currency -- I’m sorry, at constant currency. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.42 grew 19.3% and was again at the high end of our guidance range. This result was driven entirely by our strong operational performance.I want to spend a few minutes on a couple of important partnerships and how we are doing in the market. You will have seen that we announced the expansion of our partnership with Salesforce. This follows a successful launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE platform, which is powered by Force.com, Marketing Cloud, and Mulesoft. The team is now working in close collaboration with Salesforce to develop Orchestrated Clinical Trials or OCT, the first of its kind suite of integrated clinical applications designed to make clinical trials more efficient. We are very excited that this technology will be powered by Health Cloud. And we are looking forward to organic Salesforce on joint go-to-market initiatives.We continue to have success in the market with OCE. And the recent number of smaller wins continues to drive momentum. Since we launched OCE in December, we have now won 15 out of 20 competitions in this space. We will have seen -- you will have seen that we’ve issued a press release last week announcing that our OCE platform was selected by Roche for global deployment. In addition, the deal includes our ePromo, MDM, and Organization Manager applications. We are committed to investing in the success of this milestone agreement, have obviously strong execution here with strength in the offering in the marketplace, and continue to highlight our global deployment capabilities.',
                 'IRM': "Greer Aviv - Iron Mountain, Inc.Thank you, Carrie. Hello, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we refer to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all related documents as one 8-K, available on the IR website.On today's call, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results.Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2018 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in this supplemental financial information.With that, Bill, would you please begin?William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.Thank you, Greer, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I first wish to welcome Greer to Iron Mountain in her role leading Investor Relations. Finding someone who has the skills, experience, and reputation to replace Melissa wasn't easy. We therefore felt very fortunate when we found that person in Greer. So, welcome, Greer. We're very pleased you are here.To Melissa, who'll be retiring at the end of the year, I wish to take a moment to thank you as this will be your last earnings call. And Melissa, as you know, started at Iron Mountain the same time as me. And it is impossible today to thank her appropriately. But I do wish to mention that we will be eternally grateful for all she has done doing a superb job leading not only our IR function, but much of our communications as well over the last six years. She has done all this against a backdrop of the company executing an agenda, delivering significant growth to our business, which has been transformative. Thank you, Melissa. I don't know how we would have done this without you.Now, moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial performance coupled with marked progress and our strategic plan has articulated four years ago designed to support the shift in our business mix. Our plan revolves around three pillars: getting more out of our developed markets in terms of yielding cash flow, expanding our Records Management model in the faster-growing emerging markets, and building on our strong customer relationships with 950 of the Fortune 1000 coupled with our know-how in order to expand into adjacent business areas.To this end, we are very pleased by our progress across these three pillars. A few proof points of this can be readily illustrated at a high level. We continue to maximize yield from Records Management in developed markets with adjusted EBITDA margin in North America RIM now over 46% with growing internal revenue, albeit on lower volumes. We achieved internal service revenue growth of 7%, which is a result of growth in Shred in business areas such as Information Governance and Digital Solutions or IGDS. We progressed towards our goal in making Records Management in the faster growing emerging markets, a bigger part of our mix where these markets represent 18% of our revenue whilst continuing to improve EBITDAR margins which are now over 30%.And we advanced the expansion of our data center business, which even at this early stage is now making a marked impact on our EBITDA and AFFO growth given it is now more than 8% of our adjusted EBITDA and is already expected to contribute 100 to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis.All told, the consistent delivery against our strategic goals has continued to drive strong growth in profitability, is measured by year-over-year expansion in both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin supporting healthy cash flow generation to fund our business investments whilst also reducing leverage over time.As a result, this morning, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend per share in line with our 2020 plan. This is supported by our year-to-date AFFO growth of 13.7%, which is well in excess of our 8% increase in share count. For the full year, our AFFO payout ratio is expected to be sub-80% versus our original guidance midpoint of 81% even after increasing the dividend.",
                 'JKHY': "I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Kevin Williams. You may begin.Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.Thanks, Lydia (00:38). Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack & Associates (sic) [Jack Henry & Associates] (00:40) third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO.The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me, then I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business and the performance for the quarter. And then, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed. And then, we will open the line up for Q&A.I need to remind you that remarks and responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter.Total revenue increased 9% for the quarter and increased 8% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. We again had a very solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 7% for the quarter and also increased by 7% if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters.Our Payments segment performed extremely well, posting a 12% increase in revenue this quarter and an 11% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Of course, Ensenta is a contributor to this growth. But even if we exclude Ensenta, we saw more than a 5% increase in revenue through our traditional offerings. We also had a very strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, posting an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees.Our combined sales team had another nice quarter, again finishing ahead of quota. As I mentioned in the press release, it also appears that the team is on track to exceed the quota for the year. This was a well-balanced sales quarter with the sales teams posting solid numbers for several of our new solutions, including Banno, Debit Processing, the new Credit Processing Solution and Treasury Management. We also had a record number of Symitar into out signings at 13.Regarding our new first data PSU debit card offering, we now have 34 customers converted and live on the new platform. As with any conversion, we've encountered a few minor bumps, but I'm very happy to say that all of these customers are referenceable at this point. And as planned, we will begin to slowly ramp our conversion volume later in May. With regard to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we provided a very high level review of our plans in the last call, including plans to return a portion of the savings to our shareholders. Shortly after that call, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 19%. We also discussed our intent to use a portion of the TCJA savings to offer a voluntary incentive plan which would provide a large subset of our longer tenured employees the option to leave the company with a significant financial reward. We projected a Q4 expense of around $8 million as a result of this program.As we have discussed with many of you in the past, our voluntary turnover rate runs well below the industry average. This tends to provide great stability on our workforce because once people join our company, they are generally inclined to stay. We saw this same behavior reflected in the results of this special incentive program in that even though we felt we had forecasted conservatively, many fewer people took advantage of the program than we had expected. Our Q4 charge therefore will be much closer to $5.5 million than the originally projected $8 million.",
                 'JEC': "Jonathan DorosThank you. Good morning and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we'll reference in our prepared remarks. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is summarized on Slide 2. Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided by the same. Statements made in this presentation, that are not based on historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements.For a description of some risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur, that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 29, 2017 as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are under no duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this presentation to conform to actual results, except as required by applicable law.Please now turn to Slide 3 for a review of the agenda for today's call. I would like to note a few items in regards to our presentation and remarks today. Our results reported today include a review by all 3 lines of business. For comparative purposes, we have disclosed revenue and operating income for the updated structure reflecting the current quarter and accordingly, the same quarter a year ago. We plan to provide historical segment detail on a rolling-quarter basis. During the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current quarter results to Jacobs' and CH2M's performance 2017 calculated on a pro forma basis. The 2017 pro forma figures are adjusted to exclude restructuring and other related charges, the deconsolidation of CH2M's Chalk River joint venture and CH2M's MOPAC project. We believe, this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods.Turning to the agenda. Steve will begin by discussing our focus on driving a high-performance culture, a recap of third quarter results, including a market review for each of our lines of business and provide an update on the CH2M integration. Kevin will then provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. Steve will then provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and we'll open the call for questions. With that, I'll pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou.Steven DemetriouThank you, and welcome to our fiscal year 2018 third quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings per share results at the high-end of our previous outlook and well above the guidance we shared last November shortly after announcing the CH2M acquisition.Our year-to-date performance reflects strong execution against our major strategic priorities, to further strengthen our winning culture, including an increased focus on inclusion and diversity; to transform our core by executing our work with rigor and discipline; and to profitably grow by capturing higher-margin opportunities in growing end markets and delivering differentiated client-centric solutions.And with regard to the recent CH2M acquisition, we are exceeding the major cultural and financial integration commitments we made a year ago when we announced this transformative acquisition. I will discuss the Jacobs and CH2M combination in more detail later in my remarks.On a pro forma basis, third quarter revenue grew 14% versus prior year with each line of business posting growth. Adjusted SG&A cost decreased sequentially and was also lower versus the pro forma year-ago quarter, demonstrating significant progress on achieving cost synergies associated with the CH2M acquisition. Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.35 per share, an increase of 71% year-over-year. Kevin will cover the components of EPS, including a bridge to GAAP EPS in his remarks. Free cash flow generation was strong in the third quarter, and we demonstrated our ability to delever with gross debt down from the second quarter.I'm also very pleased to report that the third quarter backlog increased sequentially to $27.2 billion and is up 8% on a pro forma basis from last year's third quarter, with all 3 of our lines of business contributing to the backlog growth. Looking forward, we continue to experience strong demand across both our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear line of business, ATEN; and our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities business, BIAF. In addition, supply-demand fundamentals are strengthening in our Energy, Chemicals and Resources, ECR sector, where we are taking a disciplined approach to capturing opportunities in an improving market.",
                 'JBHT': "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your speaker for today, Mr. David Mee. Sir, you may begin.David MeeGiven that this is our first earnings call, let me kind of go over what we'd like the format to be. I'll make a brief opening statements and then we'll open up the lines for Q&A. The participants will have an opportunity to ask a question and then one follow up, before they have to return to the end of the queue to give everybody a shot at asking the questions that they want. We do have a call scheduled for 90 minutes. So we hope to get through as many questions as we can during that time. And we do appreciate your patience, given that this is the first time we've attempted this. As we go forward, I'm sure, it will be a lot more efficient into the future.As far as the opening remarks, I have two areas that I want to address. The first is the quarterly tax rate and the difference between the preannounced after-tax charge and the actual after-tax charge reported in the earnings release. The primary culprits in the reduced rates are our annual computation of what is referred to as our FIN 48 exposure, and a tax rate adjustment for equity-based compensation.At the time of the arbitration update announcement last week, we had not performed these reconciliations and had not determined the discrete item amounts. So we used our previous estimated quarterly tax rate of 26% instead of the 20.4% that Q3 ultimately generated. With this third quarter adjustment and our current estimate of what our discrete items will be in the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our full year 2018 tax rate will be 24%.The second area is, obviously, the elephant in the room, the arbitration update. And as we announced, we received the interim award on October 5, 2018. The interim award is subject to a protective order, addressing among other things, confidentiality of the award and the underlying contract. However, in that interim award, we were able to identify a quantifiable claim for a specific issue that accrued over a multiple period, that was the $18 million pretax charge we announced. We also stated that the arbitration panelists requested additional submissions from the parties over the next several months. These submissions are needed to determine, a, an appropriate interim award or awards; and b, a final award. We cannot determine any further financial implications of the interim award beyond the announced $18 million pretax charge, until after the arbitrators review the additional information required to be submitted and issue an additional interim award or final award. Once we can determine any additional financial impact of any interim award or final awards, we will provide additional disclosure at that time.Until then, we will follow what has been our standard practice during this entire process, which is, what we said in the press release is all we're going to say. So any questions on the arbitration process or on this interim award will most likely be answered with no comment, it is confidential what we have said all we're going to say or something similar.Now as we do when the investor community visits our headquarters, we've assembled the entire management team to answer your questions and talk about their businesses.With that, Donna, we're now ready to take our first question.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Amit Mehrotra.Amit MehrotraFirst one is just if you can talk about the deceleration in Intermodal volume growth, basically every quarter this year I fully understand that we have the derailment in the quarter, which likely impacted the number. But does the deceleration, I would imagine impact some price over volume focus from the management team, could you just talk about that? When do you guys expect? You did pull the volume lever or volumes to reaccelerate, just given the tight truckload market?Terrence MatthewsYes, this is Terry Matthews. We, obviously, this year, we've been focused a lot on price, and I think you're seeing the results of that in the marketplace. It's been a marketplace that I believe has been the most orderly marketplace I've seen in the 28 years I've been involved in Intermodal and I think that will continue into next year. With regards to volume, as you look in 2019, I think, you'll see a better balance between price and volume as we go forward and we'll have a more balanced approach as we hit 2019.Amit MehrotraCould you talk about what the - what you estimate the volume impact to be from the five major derailments in the quarter?Terrence MatthewsI believe it was around 4,000, 5,000 units.Amit MehrotraGot it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I guess, it was nice to see that step up in incremental margins in the third quarter over 20% kind of an underlying basis. Is that the right level to expect kind of over the next 3, 4 quarters, just given, as some of the pricing actions continue to cycle through the numbers. Is that sort of the right incremental margins you guys are targeting for the Intermodal business over the next several quarters?",
                 'SJM': "I will now turn the conference call over to Aaron Broholm, Vice President, Investor Relations.

These slides and a replay of this call will be archived on our website. If you have additional questions after today's call, please contact me.I will now turn the call over the Mark Smucker.Mark SmuckerThank you, Aaron. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Our efforts to position our business for growth continue to pay off this quarter. We achieved year-over-year sales growth driven by key brands in every business and delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth. Initial benefits of tax reform and ongoing costs discipline helped fuel EPS growth.We will continue to deliver long-term top and bottom line growth by executing our strategic road map, supporting a portfolio of leading and emerging brand and guided by a deep focus on consumer and customer insights. During our CAGNY presentation, next week, we will provide a more thorough update on our strategic roadmap and the four foundational pillars of innovation, investments, cost savings and acquisitions.This morning let me highlight our progress is reflected in our third quarter results. We achieved strong sales performance, for leading -- for key leading brands in the quarter, demonstrating the ability of our brands to win in today’s environment. This included mid-single digit sales growth for Jif, Smucker's Fruit Spreads and Milk-Bone. In addition, we achieved low-single digit growth for Folgers, driven by our Away From Home Coffee business. These gains were partially offset by reduced sales for the Crisco brand reflecting loss distribution at a key customer, and a timing related decline for Natural Balance.Net sales for our U.S. K-Cup portfolio grew 14% in the quarter with gains for all of our brands. Dunkin' Donuts and Café Bustelo K-Cups continued to deliver double-digit increases and Folgers K-Cups returned to growth in the quarter. In addition, margins on our K-Cups improved significantly all of which reflects the benefits of our enhanced partnership with Keurig Green Mountain. We're now a year into the grocery and mass channel rollout of our Nature's Recipe premium dog food brand and momentum continues.Net sales for the brand were up 24% in the third quarter and 39% year-to-date, benefiting from a national advertising campaign which is driving brand awareness and accelerating consumer takeaway, despite increase competitive activity. Momentum for the Smucker Uncrustables brand also remain strong with company-wide sales up 23% in the third quarter and on pace for another year of double-digit sales growth. In addition, construction of our new Uncrustables sandwich facility in Longmont, Colorado is on track. When complete in fiscal 2020, we will have the capacity to further accelerate growth as we expect to double net sales from the $250 million level we project for the current fiscal year.Innovation including recent product launches, such as Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Meow Mix Servings cat food contributed to sales growth in the quarter. In total, products introduced in the past three years delivered 7% of third quarter net sales. We look forward to sharing more on our innovation effort next week including the introduction of two new platforms that extend reach of our iconic Folgers and Jif brands.E-commerce also remains a significant area of strategic focus, as we continue to place emphasis on this opportunity across our brands and businesses. While still a small base year-to-date, e-commerce sales for our U.S. retail business were up 78% with pet food brands up 71% and coffee sales in the channel more than doubling. These represent two of the fastest-growing categories in e-commerce, as they are well suited for a subscription model of repeat purchases. Although not all of these sales are incremental, we continue to earn our fair share as consumers shift to online purchases. Another key component of our strategic road map is generating cost savings to provide the fuel for investments in top line growth and margin expansion.",

We anticipate today’s webcast to last approximately 75 minutes.Now, I’m pleased to share our results for the quarter.Worldwide sales were $20.3 billion for the third quarter of 2018, a 3.6% increase versus the third quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.5% as currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. In the U.S., sales were up 3.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.5% with the effect of currency exchange rates reducing our reported OUS results by 4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.5% outside the U.S. I will provide the same reference for each segment.With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $3.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.05, representing increases of 7.3% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.5%. Joe will discuss earnings further in his remarks.Beginning with Consumer, I’ll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items to build upon the slides that will be presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages reference represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2017, or in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation.Worldwide Consumer sales totaled $3.4 billion, growing 4.9%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, mainly the divestiture of the Compeed business in the Wound Care/Other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide. Performance in the quarter was positively impacted by the restocking of retail inventory to support the relaunch of our Johnson’s Baby portfolio in the U.S. that we highlighted last quarter. Excluding this impact, our adjusted operational growth was approximately 5.4%, representing above-market growth for our Consumer segment this quarter.Beauty led the Consumer segment performance growing 6.5% or just above 8% when adjusting for divestitures, primarily Nizoral. The U.S. realized strong category consumption and growth including continued strong performance in e-commerce. The NEUTROGENA brand delivered strong results, primarily reflecting growth in facial moisturizing and share gains in sun protection. Additionally, the OGX and Maui Moisture brands delivered strong performance, growing share globally.',
                 'JCI': "I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International PlcThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website.GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.78 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.03 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.81 per share compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter.Now, let me turn the call over to George.George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International PlcThanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.Let's get started with a high level review of the strategic highlights in the quarter starting on slide 3. Last quarter we began laying a foundation based on the theme of building momentum. As I think about the progress we have made in the third quarter, I would say the momentum continues on each of our key initiatives.Starting with sales capacity, based on our success in attracting high performing talent during the first half, we continue to accelerate the pace of sales adds in the third quarter, hiring an incremental 375 sales professionals. This brings our year-to-date net additions to the Building direct channel and indirect sales force to about 775 globally versus our previous expectation of 500 to 600 net adds. We expect to end the year with 900 net adds.By leveraging the Johnson Controls commercial excellence programs throughout the organization, the hallmarks of which are an appropriately designed attractive incentive compensation structure, proper onboarding and training models as well as ongoing sales management and coaching, we have seen a significant increase in the productivity of our new and existing sales teams. That, in turn, improves the customer experience and drives order growth as evidenced by the continued acceleration in Buildings orders and organic revenue growth.Our initiatives surrounding our sales force resegmentation and improved pricing discipline continue to bear fruit with further improvement in margins on orders secured in backlog. For example, margins on new orders in North America increased 110 basis points year-over-year, which compares to the 70 basis point increase we saw in Q1 and 100 basis point increase we saw in Q2.Despite a more difficult prior year comparison, our Global Products team continued to accelerate top line growth, reflecting outstanding execution and converting on the substantial investments made in capital deployed over the past several years into engineering, R&D and expanding our distribution footprint.I should also call attention to the aggressive pricing actions we have taken, particularly over the last six months to combat rising raw material and other input costs. We have achieved above average levels of price realization relative to our announced price increases year-to-date, which has enabled us to move into a modest positive price/cost position earlier than expected. Based on the timing of price recovery and assuming recent levels of inflation, we are well positioned into the fourth quarter.Buildings service revenue growth accelerated once again in the third quarter to 5% year-over-year compared to the 3% growth we experienced in the first half. I'm extremely pleased with our execution in our service businesses across the globe, particularly given the intense focus we have had on expanding our commercial capabilities and strengthening operations, while increasing our service technician capacity.At Power Solutions, we had strong organic performance in both the OE and aftermarket channels, benefiting partly from the new platform wins we discussed with you last quarter. The success in ramping shipments on the new wins can be directly attributed to the Power team's solid execution and commitment to serving our customers.",
                 'JPM': 'At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.Marianne LakeThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I’m going to take you through presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.4 billion and EPS of $2.34 on revenue of $27.8 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 17%. The result this quarter was strong. Record net income for third quarter even excluding the impact of tax reform with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.Highlights include, average core loan growth excluding the CIB up 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes and consumer were all up double digits. We gained share in global IB fees and across all regions year-to-date and in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and clients assets were both up 7%.Turning to page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Revenue of $27.8 billion was up $1.4 billion or 5% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rate, net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by market NII and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year-on-year. More than half of the increase relates to investments we’re making in technology, marketing, bankers broadly defined and real estate. And the remainder is driven by revenue related costs, principally higher auto lease depreciation and transaction expenses on higher volumes.Credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale. For the quarter, credit costs of $950 million were down $500 million year-on-year, driven by changes in consumer reserves.Briefly on page 3, turning to balance sheet and capital. So, little to say here other than as you can see, capital and risk weighted assets remained basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12%.Moving on to page four and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $4.1 billion of net income and an ROE of 31%. Core loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by home lending up 10%, business banking up 5%, card up 4% and auto loans and leases up 3%.Deposits grew 4% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the industry although slower than a year ago. According to the recently released FDIC annual survey, we grew at nearly 2 times the average and we were the fastest growing bank in 9 of our top 10 markets. Chase also earned the number one spot in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study.Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth. Card sales volume was up 12% with strength across our portfolio, and we also saw very strong debit sales performance, up 13%.Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%. Consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and the smaller markets pressuring production margins. In addition, net servicing revenue was down including the MSR.Card, merchant services, and auto revenue was up 10%, driven by higher card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net card fees on lower acquisition costs predominately offset by lower net interchange and also on higher auto lease volumes. Expense of $7 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in technology and by auto lease depreciation. The overhead ratio was 53%.Finally on credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, we built reserves in card of $150 million, largely driven by growth. And we released reserve in the home lending purchased credit-impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in home prices and delinquencies.On charge-offs, there are few moving pieces. Year-on-year charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in home lending this quarter of about $80 million, together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in auto this period last year.Excluding those, charge-offs were about flat. But, we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for card. And in card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected and credit performance remained very strong. At this point, we expect card charge-off rates for the year to be below our guidance at about 310 basis points.',
                 'JNPR': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.Jess LubertThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements.Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q3 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. Rami RahimThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better than expected results during the September quarter. Total revenues of 1.180 million was above the midpoint of our guidance, as continued strength in our enterprise business along with better than expected service provider sales more than offset weakness within the cloud. In addition, gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, while operating expenses came in towards the low end of our forecast, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.54, $0.07 above the high end of our outlook.We're seeing encouraging development in many areas of our business, which are providing confidence in our long term growth prospects. Some of these developments include the following. Our enterprise business continues to see solid momentum, rising 15% year-over-year and growing year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. Strength was experienced across all technologies and we benefited from a diverse base of customers. While our enterprise switching and security business both grew year-over-year, we also saw very strong demand for our enterprise routing portfolio, as new solutions such as the MX204 and the MX10003 are seeing solid success in areas of the market where we previously didn't play. We believe we have the right products and strategy to win in the enterprise markets and we are strengthening our go to market focus on this vertical, under our new Chief Customer Officer, Pierre-Paul Allard.Security was another bright spot in Q3, growing 8% year-over-year and rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. While our breadth of security deals was strong in the period, we were also encouraged to see an uptick in the number of transactions over $1 million. We experienced strong security booking during the September quarter and we remain optimistic, regarding the growth prospects for our security business.While our service provider revenue declined 6% year-over-year, the business grew 4% sequentially and performed better than we expected. We believe the upside relative to our expectations reflects the strengthening of our relationships with many of our top service provider customers who recognize the value of the innovations we're bringing to market. We believe our orchestration telemetry, node slicing cups and universal chassis capabilities are leading the industry and should position us to win with our service provider customers.We are also optimistic regarding the potential of our MX5G offerings, which we spec to begin shipping early next year. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the value that Juniper is offering. We believe this was highlighted at our recent NXTWORK’s user conference, where customer and partner attendance more than doubled year-over-year. We’re excited about new and expanding partnerships with firms like Nutanix and Ericsson, which we expect to not only strengthen our ability to capitalize on multi-cloud and 5G initiatives, but also broaden our reach and drive competitive advantage versus alternative offerings.We're also in the early stages of ramping several important new innovations, such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and the SPC3 line cards for our high end SRX firewall, both of which began shipping in the third quarter. These platforms bring material differentiation to the market and are already seeing strong customer traction, which should prove accretive to growth in future quarters.Not to be overlooked, we're on the verge of introducing the industry's first 400-gig product and believe we will be well positioned to gain share, as cloud, service provider and enterprise customers look to meet surging bandwidth requirements. Our software business had another strong quarter, rising both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and accounting for nearly 10% of our revenue. While this strength was due to several one-time license buys and we do not expect our software business to remain at this level over the next few quarters, we continue to introduce new software solutions to the market and are putting go to market strategies in place in order to drive higher software attach rates in future periods.",

All reconciliations to GAAP could be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, please go ahead.Patrick OttensmeyerOkay. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call.I'll start with just a brief comment on Slide 4, introduction of today's presenters and I think you are very familiar with most of us. I will acknowledge the addition of Mike Naatz, as of October 1, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.Draw your attention I think most of you saw the press release on September 10 announcing the change in our lineup here with Mike coming over to the Chief Marketing Officer role and Brian Hancock moving into the job of really previously held by Mike with a rebranding of the Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer, happy to talk about that in the Q&A section.For purposes of today's discussion and presentation Brian will handle all of the sales and marketing commentary on the call today since he was in that job for the entire third quarter but you will be hearing more from Mike going forward.Moving to Slide 5, just a quick recap of the results for the quarter. We had record revenues for any quarter and in the third quarter of this year with an increase of 6% over last year on 4% volume growth. Brian, will talk about some of the growth drivers in his commentary, but we saw a number of our oversize growth opportunities continue to hit full stride in the quarter and feel very good about the condition of the business in a number of those areas.Third quarter operating ratio reported of 62.0%. Adjusting for some items specifically, the flood recovery in the third quarter from Hurricane Harvey last year, which Mike Upchurch will cover in more detail, our operating ratio was 63.4%, which was an improvement of a full point over last year.Third quarter earnings per share reported of $1.70, again adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.57 which was an increase of 16% from the prior year. Now this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I think most of you have done the math and have concluded that our volume guidance that we have given in the second quarter of mid-single digits is going to be hard to achieve based on our - I think the guidance we gave was 3% to 4% at the end of the second quarter. Given our results for the third quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year, we are now shifting that to low single digit year-over-year volume growth for the full-year of 2018.And I'll remind you that a couple of important drivers to our revenue guidance been brought down over the course of the year was the delay in the start up of some crude oil moves that we thought was going to start maybe as early as the first quarter of this year, which didn't materialize until much later. But it is moving and contributing to our growth from this point forward.And then the second factor was service related issues, which, Jeff will get into in some detail here that have cost us some opportunities to grow in the second and third quarter.So, if you look at this on the surface it's hard to feel bad about our performance record revenues, operating ratio improvement of 1% over the last year on an adjusted basis and earnings per share growth of 16% year-over-year but our performance this quarter did not meet our own expectations and some of the expectations that we articulated earlier in the year, we will get better. Our service issues, we're seeing improvement. Everyday we're getting a little better, the inventories and metrics are improving.And Jeff will get into that in greater detail. And I'll turn the mic over to Jeff right now. Thank you.Jeffrey SongerOkay. Thank you, Pat. Good morning.Starting with review of operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 7, overall velocity in Dwell saw a significant impacts related to congestion in our border region. While Houston congestion eased at the start of the quarter, we were not able to work off the backlog of traffic that built in Mexico during that time which led to elevated volumes entering peak season.This residual excess inventory accompanied by substantial year-over-year growth in cross-border traffic of 13% and 20% in quarters two and three respectively, strained our operation in the region. Excessive Dwell in our Monterrey and Sanchez terminals was the most pronounced during the quarter.Expanding upon these terminals, Monterrey is a high-volume terminal with significant local daily switching demand across the large number of customers. Elevated inventories have been slow to work off due to the inherent complexity of this operation. Our long-term operating plan for this area is to move some of the switching activity for Monterrey into Sanchez, where we will be able to handle the increasing volumes more efficiently.We also experienced some growing pains this quarter associated with the new Sanchez yard switching operation, a newly expanded mechanical work at the facility.As congestion eases we should continue to gain efficiencies from our investment in Sanchez and our continued work with cross-border, customs, and international crew processes. Estimated cost due to the congestion of approximately $7 million during the quarter related primarily to increased equipment cost, labor and overtime.Turning to Slide 8. Expanding on service recovery efforts, this chart reflects our Mexico cars online trend over the past several months. As indicated in earlier comments, events earlier in the year led to significant inventories primarily in Northern Mexico. However as shown here the total number of cars online in Mexico has reduced significantly from peak levels.Network velocity has shown steady improvement over the past few weeks and Dwell has moderated from highs as we saw in the early September timeframe.Additional actions taken to restore service include adding resources to Northern Mexico. We are leasing 30 additional locomotives in the short-term and have temporarily relocated crews into the region. We have implemented some new service plans and moderate terminal and work with the largest customers to right-size some of their equipment.We continue to work constructively with our interchange partners to ensure system fluidity. While we will see pressure on performance metrics in Q4 as we continue to work down overall inventories, we believe these metrics are heading in the right direction and we expect to see more normalized levels in the next few weeks.Other comments for the quarter included an update on PTC. I'm happy to announce that all of our PTC required subdivisions are in revenue service and we are turning our focus towards interoperability. I want to recognize the entire team for their outstanding work with PTC which has had very little operational impact during the past 12 months of revenue service implementation.",
                 'K': "At this time, I will turn the call over to John Renwick, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy for Kellogg Company. Mr. Renwick, you may begin your conference call.John Renwick, CFA - Kellogg Co.Thank you, Brandon. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for a review of our third quarter 2018 results.

As always, when referring to our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted.And I'll now turn it over to Steve and slide number 3.Steven A. Cahillane - Kellogg Co.Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another quarter of good progress under Deploy For Growth. We said we would increase our investment in brands and capabilities, and we did. We continued to improve consumption trends worldwide across most of our categories in the United States and in other developed markets around the world. We sustained our accelerated organic growth rate in our emerging markets. And we continued to expand distribution and consumption for single-serve pack formats, which are outpacing our categories.Now, I recognize that the first thing many of you will notice about our third quarter results is that our operating profit came in short of our guidance. This was due to choices we made during the quarter to invest in our budding momentum. We again increased brand-building investment and we again leaned into single-serve items, even though they generated higher costs. Most of the shortfall from these factors was in a single business unit, which is U.S. Snacks, but these did not reflect any deterioration in our fundamentals in that business unit or elsewhere.As the quarter progressed, we elected not to offset these investments and costs just to deliver a targeted operating profit. For instance, we could have lifted our foot off the gas pedal on our expansion of single-serve on-the-go items, many of which are co-packed and require additional transportation in a high freight cost environment, but we chose not to, instead leaning into these pack formats that are meeting key consumer occasions and incremental to our brand's growth. Again, this principally took place in our U.S. Snacks business where on-the-go is a critical occasion for us to win.Similarly, at any time, we could have pulled back on brand-building investment, but we chose not to, instead increasing brand-building at a strong, high single-digit rate year-over-year because that is what is getting our brands back on firmer growth footing. A great example is RX, where we moved ahead with its first-ever national advertising campaign, even before realizing its full distribution expansion and on top of rolling out a new nut butters platform and a relaunched kids' line.What's important is that these investments are working. You can see this in the improvement in our consumption and net sales growth this year. We generated organic growth, despite the remaining mechanical impact of our DSD exit and despite notably tougher second half comparisons. Improved consumption growth brings improved net sales growth, and we're seeing both. We also really like what we see going on in our portfolio, which we're shaping through investment decisions, SKU rationalization and M&A.The Q3 benefits of these portfolio improvements are summarized on slide number 4, and will be described in more detail in the coming slides. Our consumption trends are improving around the world, including in the United States. And many of our biggest brands grew share in the quarter, as did many of our smaller challenger brands. Post-DSD U.S. Snacks is now stronger, thanks to a rationalized SKU lineup, increased brand investment and a deliberate expansion of on-the-go offerings. And in Q3, it continued to improve its velocities overall and gain share in key supported brands. Frozen Foods is sustaining its solid momentum. Our cereal business in core international developed markets have stabilized, and we showed signs of improvement in our U.S. cereal business in Q3.Also in Q3, we sustained an accelerated growth rate in our expanding emerging markets. This acceleration comes not only from adding West Africa to our consolidated results this year – and that business continues to grow rapidly, by the way – but also from accelerating our organic growth rate across our emerging markets, sustaining a high single-digit growth rate that is meaningfully higher than in recent years. This emerging markets growth is contributing to, but not solely responsible for, good growth in net sales and operating profit across all three of our international regions. So these are the elements to listen for as we get into the details of the quarter.",
                 'KEY': 'Beth MooneyThank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. In the room with me is Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Gorman, President of Banking, and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question and answer segment of our call. I’m now turning to Slide 3. We reported solid results this quarter with earnings per share of $0.45, up 2% from last quarter and almost 30% from the year-ago period. Our results drove improvement in our cash efficiency ratio, which was 58.7%, and our return on average common tangible equity was 16.8%, both up over 300 basis points from the year-ago period. Revenue was up 3% from last year driven by broad based growth across our company, with positive trends in our community bank and corporate bank. Our growth reflects the success of our business model, competitive positioning in the market, and investments we continue to make across the franchise.Average loans grew 2% from the prior year and were down slightly from the prior quarter. The decline in average balances were impacted by a lower starting point coming into the quarter. Importantly, we saw stronger commercial loan growth as we moved through the quarter, which is reflected in our period end balances which were up 1% from the prior quarter. We expect to see further growth in the fourth quarter, which Don will cover in his comments.Underlying trends in our fee-based businesses remain strong. Investment banking and debt placement fees grew compared to the prior quarter and year-ago period, reaching a new record for the trailing 12 months. Driving this quarter’s results were strong advisory and loan syndications as well as continued benefit from our acquisition of Cain Brothers. We also continue to be disciplined with our expense management. This quarter, expenses were relatively stable after adjusting for merger-related charges in the year-ago period and from notable items last quarter, and we accomplished this despite the added costs from Cain Brothers acquisition and other investments that we continue to make in our business. We remain committed to further efficiency improvement and reaching our targeted range of 54 to 56%.The final two sections on this slide highlight our strong position in terms of both risk management and capital. Credit quality remains a strength with net charge-offs to loans of 27 basis points. We believe that maintaining our moderate risk profile will serve us well as we move through different parts of the credit cycle.Our approach to capital has remained consistent and focused on maintaining a strong capital position while returning a large portion of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our 2018 capital plan, our board of directors increased our common stock dividend by 42% to $0.17 per share in the third quarter. We also repurchased $542 million of common shares. Key’s common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%.Overall, it was another good quarter for Key with broad based growth across our franchise. We continue to be disciplined with expenses while investing for growth and maintaining our credit underwriting standards. This resulted in strong bottom line performance which drove further improvement in both efficiency and returns, and we are positioned to build on our momentum as we move through the end of the year. As Don will discuss in his remarks, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter driven by linked quarter revenue growth and relatively stable expense, which will result in our sixth consecutive year of positive operating leverage. Despite the recent sell-off in bank stocks, we remain positive about our long-term outlook and the steps we have taken to position the company to perform through the business cycle.Before I turn the call over to Don, I wanted to mention our upcoming investor day that we are hosting on October 30. The purpose of the event is to expand more on our business model, strategies and positioning, and to showcase our strong leadership team. If you are an analyst or an institutional investor and have not yet received an invitation, please contact our Investor Relations team. We are also making the event available to all of our important stakeholders through a live webcast that can be accessed through the IR webpage.With that, let me hand the call over to Don.Don KimbleThanks Beth, and I’m on Slide 5. As Beth said earlier, we recorded third quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.45 per common share. Our results compare to $0.32 per share in the year-ago period and $0.44 in the second quarter. I will cover many of the remaining items in the rest of my presentation, so I’m now turning to Page 6.',

We hope to see many of you there.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.Ron NersesianThank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high-end of our guidance.Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next generation technologies, and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion and both core revenue and orders grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We've achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached the new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth, and the second quarter out of the last four quarters with orders above $1 billion.Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17%, or 15% on a core basis, to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions and commercial communications, aerospace, defense and governments, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services.Our technology leadership solutions and industry-focused approach continues to advance our footprint in key end-markets undergoing technology transformations. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within marquee Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers so far this year.This quarter, we saw very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end-market. Broad 5G related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystems, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and our advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G. In Q3, this translated triple-digit 5G order growth.We are the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group along with our Nemo Solutions team from the Anite acquisition, secured key design wins for a leading edge RAN and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions.",
                 'KMB': "It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Mr. Paul Alexander.Paul AlexanderThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Here with us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Hsu, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Maria Henry, our CFO.Today's call will focus on three things, our third quarter 2018 results, our full-year outlook, and this morning's announcement that Mike Hsu has been elected Kimberly-Clark's next Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2019. This morning, you'll hear from Tom, Mike, and Maria, and then we'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investor section of our Web site.As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements this morning. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. Finally, we'll be referring to adjusted results and outlook; both exclude certain items described in this morning's earnings news release. That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures.Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.Tom FalkThanks, Paul, and good morning everyone. I'd like to be the first to congratulate Mike Hsu on his upcoming move to become Chief Executive Officer of Kimberly-Clark. So congratulations, Mike. The Board of Directors and I have been working on this succession plan for several years, and it was my recommendation that Mike is the right choice and now is the right time. So this is a carefully planned and natural transition. And I'm confident Mike is the right leader to build on Kimberly-Clark's nearly 150-year legacy of caring for the needs of people around the world while delivering top-tier performance. He is passionate about our people, our brands and our businesses, and he has a deep understanding of what it takes to win in the marketplace.Now, let me hand the call over to Mike.Mike HsuGood morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank you, Tom, for your tremendous leadership of Kimberly-Clark over the past 35 years, especially the last 16 years as CEO. And during your tenure, you really transformed KC into one of the world's leading consumer products companies. You've also been a great mentor to me, and I'm honored to lead this great company, and I'm excited about our future.So now, back to the business at hand, I'm going to turn the call over to Maria to talk about the third quarter results.Maria HenryOkay. Well, congratulations, both Tom and Mike. Tom, your great leadership and mentorship since I joined in 2015, and Mike, looking forward to the future. So, as awkward as it is, I'm going to pivot to the headlines for the quarter, so let's get into it.Organic sales were up 1% driven by 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. Margins and operating profit were impacted by significant commodity inflation and negative foreign currency effects. Helping to partially offset those headwinds, we delivered strong cost savings and reduced overheard spending. And with the benefit of lower taxes, our adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. And finally, we continue to return cash to shareholders.Now, let's look at the details of the results, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 2% year-on-year with a three-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales increased 1% versus a year ago. Net selling prices and product mix each improved 1%, while volumes fell one point.Moving on to profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margin was 33.2%, down 250 basis points year-on-year. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.4%, down 120 basis points. Commodities were a drag of $210 million in the quarter, primarily due to pulp and other raw materials. We're now expecting that full-year commodity inflation will be in the upper-half of our previous estimate of $675 million to $775 million.Foreign currencies were also a sizable headwind in the quarter, reducing operating profit by a high single-digit rate. On the other hand, we achieved $105 million of FORCE cost savings, including significant benefits from negotiated short-term raw material contracts. We also delivered $40 million of cost savings from our restructuring program. In terms of that program, we're making good progress overall, including closing a small consumer tissue converting facility in Latin America this quarter.In addition to the restructuring, we also continue to reduce our overhead costs. In total, between-the-line spending declined 150 basis points as a percentage of net sales. All in all, adjusted operating profit was down 8%.On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.71, up 7% year-on-year. That included significant benefit from a lower tax rate, along with lower interest and share count. We now expect the full-year tax rate will be between 21% to 22%, which is better than our estimate of 23% from three months ago, largely because of some planning initiatives.I'm pleased that our effective tax rate is expected to be below target this year. Looking ahead at this point, I expect our rate in 2019 will move back up somewhere into the 23% to 26% range that we initially targeted for 2018. Therefore, we're expecting that the tax rate will be a pretty significant year-on-year earnings headwind for us in 2019.",
                 'KIM': "I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.David BujnickiGood morning. And thank you for joining Kimco's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, Kimco's CFO; David Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the call.As a reminder, statements made during the course of the call may be deemed forward-looking. And it is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the Company's SEC filings that address such factors.During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our Web site.With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.Conor FlynnThanks Dave and good morning everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter performance and give an update on our leasing and redevelopment progress, two critical components of our growth strategy. Ross will then report on our quarterly transaction activity and describe the overall transactional environment. Finally, Glenn will provide details on key metrics and our updated 2018 guidance.Overall, the economy is healthy and consumer confidence is near at 18-year high as we enter the critical holiday season. Retail sales growth projections for this holiday season from both the National Retail Federation and ICSC are north of 4%, and we anticipate that our transformed portfolio will benefit from increased traffic and purchasing power. Having made the strategic decision to increase our dispositions in 2018, our portfolio is now well positioned to embrace the dynamic change in retail that is unfolding right before our eyes, and moving at a faster pace than anyone could have imagine. We were seeing major shifts in consumer preferences and shopping habits, impacting every retail category, which has resulted in a form of retail Darwinism.While some legacy retailer have been unable to adapt and compete in the renew environment, resulting in reorganization or liquidation, there are many more savvy well capitalized and experienced retailers who have successfully adapted their business models and are flourishing. We are also seeing many new and creative concepts stepping in and grabbing market share at a rapid cliff. Off-price continues to thrive. Our recent National Retail Federation survey showed that 89% of consumers shop at discount retailers and their appeal spans across ages and income groups. Retailers like Walmart and Target have gone on the offensive with acquisitions or new store concepts and the results are showing. Target, for example, recorded traffic growth of 6.4% in its most recent earnings report, by far the strongest since the Company began reporting traffic in 2008.Comparable sales increased 6.5%, which was Target’s best comp in 13-years. Health and wellness concepts and trends continue to create new demand across categories, from new forms of exercise classes to restaurants and to fashion. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, with other new retail concepts and categories continuing to emerge. So, while change in the retail sector maybe disconcerting to the investor, the fact of the matter is that there are more store openings than closings. And the changes occurring in the shopping center landscape are for the better. Why for the better? Because the survivors and new comers are better capitalized and better prepared to adapt the consumers' changing taste and needs.Kimco's vision and strategy dovetails with this continuous evolution by focusing on place making and reinvesting in our best assets to create live-work-play experiences. The key is having the right real estate, an exceptional team and a rock solid balance sheet. The quality of Kimco’s real estate is validated on a daily basis. As the demand for space in our shopping center portfolio remains strong with new and expanding retailers continuing to see great locations. This is also reflected in our key metrics with continued strength in leasing spreads occupancy and same side NOI. Our new lease spreads are 12.1% continue our streak of 19 quarters in a row with spreads over 10%.Our portfolio occupancy remains strong to 95.8% despite the slight impact from the Toys R Us vacates.. While our small shop occupancy has reached at an all time high of 98.8%. As to Toys R Us, we have executed leases or leases have been assumed on more than 60% of Toys R Us spaces, or 13 of 21 boxes with LOIs and leases pending on all remaining locations. The demand has been strong but the primary drivers coming from the leaders and off-price furniture, hobby, fitness and entertainment.",
                 'KMI': 'I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.Rich KinderThank you, Kim. Before we begin, as usual, I’d like to remind you that today’s earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call include forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Exchange Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of KMI’s and KML’s earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.As I usually do before turning the call over to Steve Kean and the team, let me make a few comments regarding our long-term strategy and financial philosophy. I have talked repeatedly about our ability to generate large amounts of cash and to use that cash to benefit our shareholders in a number of ways, through reinvesting it in expansion projects to grow our future cash flow; paying dividends; delevering our balance sheet and buying back shares. We are utilizing our cash in all these ways, and this past quarter demonstrates that.In many respects, because a fine job done by Steve Kean and the whole KMI team, the third quarter was in my view, a pivotal one for the Company. Beyond good operational and financial performance, we have substantially improved our balance sheet extricated ourselves on favorable financial terms from the Trans Mountain expansion that was problematic in view unrelenting opposition from the government of British Columbia, and we have developed additional significant expansion projects which should allow us to continue to grow our cash flow in the future.Regarding our growth prospects, I believe we can develop good higher return infrastructure projects in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion per year. In short, we are demonstrating that we can generate strong and growing cash flow and employ that cash and benefit our shareholders. That is the essence of our long-term financial strategy at Kinder Morgan. And like many of you on this call, I’m puzzled and frustrated that our stock price does not reflect our progress and future outlook, but I do believe that in the long term, markets are rational and that the true value of our strong cash generating assets will be appropriately valued.And with that I will turn it over to Steve.Steve KeanOkay. Thank you. As usual, we will be covering both KMI and KML on this afternoon’s call. I’m going to start with a high level update and outlook on KMI, then turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give you the update on segment performance. David Michels, KMI CFO will take you through the numbers. Then, I will give you a high level update on KML and will take you through the numbers and a couple of other topics there. Then, we will answer your questions on both companies.We had a pivotal quarter on KMI and KML, highlighted by the closing early in our schedule of our transaction to sell the Trans Mountain pipeline with government of Canada, which removed considerable uncertainty, while providing significant value to KML and KMI shareholders. With respect to KMI, we are having a very strong year. We are well above plan for the first three quarters and now project that we will exceed our financial targets for full-year 2018. And I think that includes our EBITDA, DCF, and our leverage metric targets. We expect to achieve this outperformance, notwithstanding the absence of earnings contribution from Trans Mountain, the delay in the completion of Elba, and the termination of a contract in our Gulf LNG joint venture, none of which was assumed when we put the budget together.What that tells you is that our underlying business is very strong. We also made our final investment decision along with our partner EagleClaw on the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline project in the third quarter. We have now sold out all of the available capacity to Bcf a day under long-term contracts, as we projected when we FID project. We have also already secured our pipe supply, which is a big mitigation of risk in the current trade environment. We revised our debt to EBITDA target down from 5.0 to approximately 4.5 times with the KML announcement regarding use of proceeds and KMI’s announcement that we will apply KMI share approximately $2 billion U.S. to debt reduction. We are achieving our leverage target.We’re having a very good year, strong financial performance, tremendous progress in the balance sheet, we’re finding good opportunities to deploy capital on attractive project on our great network of assets. This has been a pivotal quarter for KMI.Looking ahead, here are priorities: Complete the distribution of the Trans Mountain proceeds and continue our discussions on turning to positive indications that we now have from all three rating agency into positive ratings actions; continue executing on our project backlog, particularly the completion of Elba and the advancement of our Gulf Coast Express and PHP; continue maximizing the benefit of our unparalleled gas network, seek to add attractive return projects to our backlog as we did this quarter with the condition of PHP; continue returning value to our shareholders with a growing and well-covered dividend.',
                 'KLAC': "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us. I plan to briefly cover three items in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick review of KLA-Tencor's outstanding results in the March quarter, followed by highlights of our very strong market performance in 2017 as reported by Gartner, and concluding with our updated growth outlook for the industry and for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2018.Let's begin with the March quarter highlights. I'm very happy to report another record quarter for KLA-Tencor, with revenue topping $1 billion for the first time in March and finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.02. These results were driven by our ongoing focus on customer success and technology leadership and reflect the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace across each of our major product groups and in services.Also, on March 19 we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech, Limited. This acquisition is the next chapter in the progression of KLA-Tencor strategies for profitable growth and long-term value creation. With this combination, KLA-Tencor will be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services, extending our reach to address even more of the electronics value chain from semiconductor device manufacturing to packaging, printed circuit board and flat panel display manufacturing.We have kicked off the integration planning and regulatory review efforts, and these processes are moving forward as planned. We are very impressed with the Orbotech team and are excited about the opportunities that this combination will create as we execute our strategies to benefit customers, stockholders and employees. Coupled with the momentum we are experiencing in our core inspection and measurement business, and with the prospect of augmenting that growth with the new assets from Orbotech, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for KLA-Tencor.Turning now to highlights of the recently published Gartner market report for 2017. The data shows that in a very strong year for wafer fab equipment investment and with memory customers accounting for approximately 65% of overall WFE demand in 2017, KLA-Tencor grew or maintained a strong market position and drove SAM expansion in each of our major product markets, while addressing increasingly more complex inspection and measurement requirements in the marketplace.With WFE forecasted to remain at a high level in 2018, we expect overall process control intensity to grow in the year, driven by growing value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China. As a leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to strengthen our position in China, both in terms of customer footprint and adoption.We are still on the early stages of a multiyear investment cycle in China which represents a tremendous opportunity for KLA-Tencor. The presence of subscale factories under tremendous pressure to yield while still in start-up mode and the overall complexity associated with developing a world-class semiconductor industry will drive significant growth for our business in the region.In addition, the high level of investment by memory customers has driven an unprecedented investment cycle in unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology to support capacity growth in wafer manufacturers and IC fabs, as well as to meet more stringent wafer cleanliness and wafer flatness specifications in vertical NAND. These products experienced record demand in 2017 with order momentum continuing in 2018 and with shipments and revenue expected to scale in this calendar year and into 2019.",

We are very pleased to be reporting another quarter of solid financial results.Comp sales on a shifted basis increased 2.5% our fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. We experienced growth in both our national and proprietary brand and a good performance across the company, with particular strength in apparel led by our men’s and children’s businesses.Our ongoing focus on inventory management and speed to market resulted in another great quarter of inventory reduction on a shifted basis and contributed to a 25 basis point increase in gross margin.Our sustained momentum demonstrates the traction we are continuing to gain with our product, marketing, digital and store initiatives, while our focus on operational excellence was a key part in driving our 40% increase in third quarter earnings per share.And while we feel great about the short term results we are delivering, we are also continuing to invest in our business for the long term. The entire organization across our stores, distribution centers, call centers and corporate offices are executing at an incredible level with great discipline, speed and agility. I’m encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw throughout the quarter and the momentum that we are bringing into the holiday season.I’ll now turn the call over to Bruce, who will provide details on our third quarter financial results. After Bruce’s remarks, I will return to add more color on the business, update you on our key initiatives and provide some initial thoughts on the holiday season.Bruce BesankoThank you, Michelle and good morning everyone. As just mentioned, comp sales for the quarter increased 2.5% on a shifted basis, consistent with our reporting in prior quarters; this shifted comp adjusts for the 53-week last year by comparing sales for the 13-week periods ended November 3, 2018 and November 4, 2017. So our shifted comp of 2.5% is a like-for-like comparable sales figure.As a reminder, additional information on the calendar shift can be found in the appendix of the June 16, 2018 analyst meet-and-greet presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations pages of our corporate Website.Digital was especially strong with another mid-teen increase. We’re also pleased with the results from our stores which were essentially flat for the quarter. Our driving traffic initiative helped us achieve a positive trend in transactions which together with an increase in average transaction value resulted in a positive comp for the quarter.From a line of business perspective, we saw a broad strength with all lines of business reporting positive comps, except for the accessories business which was essentially flat. As Michelle mentioned, men’s and children’s were particularly strong, women’s was positive in the second consecutive quarter and reported strong sequential improvement as the quarter progressed.For the company, all three periods had positive comps with October being the strongest. From an omni channel perspective, all regions reported positive comps with the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions being the strongest.",
                 'KHC': "I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our third quarter and nine months results as well as our view on the path forward from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, Paulo Basilio, President of our U.S. Zone, will join the rest of us for the Q&A session.Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.Now let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Three months ago, we said that we expected organic growth from Q3 onwards, driven by a stronger more incremental marketing and innovation pipeline, leveraging investments in category management and go-to-market capabilities and supported by incremental merchandising spend and best-in-class customer service.Today, we believe and are confident our Q3 results show that the turnaround of our top line performance is firmly underway, not just in terms of headline organic growth, but also real volume growth.The transitory factors that negatively impacted first half sales are fading as expected and we saw further improvement in consumption trends in most countries, in most key categories. In fact on a global basis, more than half of our categories saw consumption growth in Q3.In our categories in United States, are going to a trend bend, with aggregate consumption across our categories, improving nearly 2 percentage points in Q3 versus Q2. Excluding planters club entity, they are flipping from negative to positive.Our market shares are also improving. Across the total company, Kraft Heinz is holding or growing share in more than half of our categories, including very strong market share gains in our Rest of World markets.And finally, we continue to see solid performance in non-measured channels, including e-commerce and global foodservice. Breakthrough innovation and strong in-store activity, distribution gains and whitespace expansion are coming together.Overall, while we did provide solid end market support for these activities and pricing in Q3 was down versus the prior year, it's important to note that our commercial growth is positive.Commercial profitability or the profit contribution from price, volume and mix is positive and growing. Execution is improving, and our pipeline is getting stronger, both in terms of innovation and go-to-market initiatives.At the same time, third quarter profitability was held back by several one-off factors, including commercial investments, the unfavorable impacts of bonus accrual versus 2017 and supply chain inflation as we expected, but also, by our decision to prioritize customer service as you saw volumes ramp-up and for goals, some degree of profitability in the short term.In the end, we are confident pushing commercial growth higher, given the greater visibility we have on both retailer support and consumer interest in our programming as well as below-the-line for favorability from both tax and lower-than-expected interest expenses that we see coming through.And as David will discuss, we are equally confident that profitability will improve going forward, as one-off negative factors from Q3 fall away. But before I hand it over to David, I think it's important to recognize that the commercial growth you're now seeing, and I believe that are in the path to sustainable, profitable growth, and driven by the fact that we are adapting the company with speed. And doing these two investments in both, our people and in-house capabilities.On the slide 3, we show this fixed goals from the post integration framework, we introduced early this year. During the third quarter, we continued to make good progress in each one of those areas. More important, the different investments and in-house capability we have built are now coming together for measurable, sustainable gains and making our brands more relevant than ever.For instance, look at our efforts in data driven marketing and brand building and innovation, we can see in United States that our ratio of quality impression to total impression is at 75%, significantly outpacing the industry average, (6:52) impression, I expect it to be up 9% in 2018 versus the prior year.",
                 'KR': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Rebekah ManisThank you, Laura. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, that Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you.I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.Rodney McMullenThank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.At our investor conference at the end of October, we shared several big ideas. The defining ideas is that we are transforming our business model to Restock Kroger and then beyond. We will grow market share by both redefining Kroger customer experience and alternative profit streams through complementary businesses and partnerships.Redefining the customer experience means offering customers incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering and friendly and caring associates. Delivering an exceptional customer experience through the Kroger ecosystem creates incremental new profit streams which in turn drives the economic model that makes the seamless experience possible.In this way, our new growth model will be a virtuous cycle. This all means that Kroger is also reinventing our financial model. We're moving from a traditional grocer to a growth company with both a strong customer ecosystem that offers anything, anytime, anywhere, an asset like high margin alternative partnerships and services. I will break it down a bit more detail. Successful long term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top line.At our investor conference, we highlighted one of the most successful to-date Kroger Personal Finance as well as several businesses under our 8451 portfolio including our Kroger Precision Marketing media offering.Kroger Personal Finance delivered record year-to-date profit and is on track for the most profitable year ever. Our high margin media business is strong and growing. Revenue for Kroger Precision Marketing powered by 8451 is up more than 150% year-to-date. One service line our boosted products and search business where advertisers can influence how their products show up on our sites benefited advertisers with more than 700 million product impressions in the third quarter alone.Personalized to Kroger shoppers with click to conversion rates that are 2x to 3x the industry standard. We see tremendous potential in these asset like margin rich businesses, build off of a robust grocery supermarket experience which is being redefined everyday at Kroger.Nowhere is this more obvious than digital. Our digital sales grew by over 60% in the third quarter. Our seamless coverage area now reaches more than 90% of Kroger households. This includes Kroger pickup and delivery. Kroger Ship is now available in all supermarket divisions. Ship customers can shop from a curated selection informed by 8451 data and insights of more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter the most to our customers plus our 4,500 Our Brands products available only from Kroger.We are aggressively investing to build digital platforms because they give our customers the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger and because they're a catalyst to grow our business and improve margins in the future.As we stated at our Investor Day, we expect to be able to cover not only 100% of our customers but also the entire U.S. population. Our Brands continue to perform exceptionally well with customers and is one of the most profitable parts of our supermarket business. Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.6% of sales dollars both of which are record third quarter results. Our Private Selection and Simple Truth brands saw strong sales, units and gross margin gains in the third quarter.Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic is our fastest growing brand with sales up double digits again in this third quarter. As we've shared previously, Our Brands account for 4 of the top 5 items sold through Kroger pickup and 41 of the top 50 items sold on Kroger Ship.We have now been executing for three quarters our Restock Kroger plan to create shareholder value by redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value, developing talent and living our purpose.",
                 'LB': "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Amie Preston, Chief Investor Relations Officer for L Brands. Please go ahead.Amie PrestonThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to L Brands' third quarter earnings conference call for the period ending Saturday, November 3, 2018.As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our Safe Harbor statements found in our SEC filings. Our third quarter earnings release, additional commentary, and earnings presentation are all available on our Web site, lb.com.As you know, 2017 was a 53-week year. All of the sales dollars, margin and operating income results discussed on this call are on a reported basis for the quarter ending November 3, 2018 versus October 28, 2017. Comparable sales are on a comparable calendar period for the quarter ending November 3, 2018 versus 13-week period ended November 4, 2017.Additionally, all the results discussed on the call today are adjusted results and exclude the charges related to the closure of the Henri Bendel business and store impairments described in our press release.I’d also like to clarify that the fourth quarter and full year sales to comp spread in our commentary yesterday excludes the extra week last year. Including the extra week, the sales to comp spread in the fourth quarter is negative 2 points and for the full year is 2 to 3 points.Stuart Burgdoerfer, EVP and CFO; and I will handle the call today. As you know, we have leadership transitions in the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses and our other leaders are focused on executing the important holiday time period. Thanks.And now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.Stuart BurgdoerferThanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. As outlined in the third quarter commentary that we released yesterday afternoon, the L Brands’ management team is very clear minded about where we are. Parts of the business; Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret Beauty, and our international franchise business are performing very well. However, our overall results are unacceptable driven by declines in Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK.We made some important decisions in the quarter including the decision to close the Henri Bendel business, pursuing alternatives for La Senza, and reducing our dividend and committing to deleverage to enable us to increase our focus on our core businesses and strengthen our company in the long term. Our number one priority is improving performance at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK.We have new leadership in place or to come. Amy Hauk has joined the PINK business and John Mehas will be joining us from Tory Burch in early 2019 to lead the Victoria’s Secret Lingerie business. We’re committed to a full review of the business. Everything is on the table, including our brand positioning, marketing, talent, real estate, cost structure and most importantly our merchandize assortments.By executing against our strategy, focusing on the fundamentals, staying close to our customers and leveraging the strength of our brands, we will deliver on our commitments for our stakeholders; customers, associates and shareholders.Thanks. And over to you, Amie.Amie PrestonThanks, Stuart. That concludes our prepared comments. At this time, we’d be happy to take any questions you might have. In the interest of time and consideration to others, please limit yourself to one question.Thanks. And I’ll turn it back over to Heidi.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Alexandra WalvisGood morning and thank you for taking the questions. You mentioned that you were looking at potentially bringing back some of the categories that you have been in before, including swimwear, footwear, eyewear. Could you talk us through a little bit about what that might look like? Why the choice of pursuing those via licensing arrangement, for example? Thank you.Stuart BurgdoerferSure. Thanks for the question. Well, it’s an important decision and fundamentally a decision that reflects listening to our customers. We’ll be back in the swim business in the spring of 2019. And as we shared in our circulated commentary, we’re going to be entering some other exited categories. We’ve already begun marketing and selling boots, for example, but also eyewear and other licensed businesses.And importantly, we’ll be back in the swim business in 2019. Naturally, you would have follow-on questions about specifically when and how much and a quantification of those things. We are developing our plans in detail; nothing more to share today. But again, a very important decision to reenter some important businesses and pursue other growth initiatives through a licensing approach. Thanks.Amie PrestonThanks, Alex. Next question, please.",
                 'LH': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America HoldingsGood morning and welcome to LabCorp's third quarter 2018 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.In addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 2018 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, and the opportunities for future growth.These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q, and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America HoldingsThank you, Scott, and good morning. LabCorp's results in the quarter were highlighted by year-over-year revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our performance was driven by strong results of our Covance business this quarter with increased net orders, a 1.41 book-to-bill, organic revenue growth of over 7% and 130 basis points of margin expansion. These are clear indications that our investments in the business, our differentiated offering and our Covance LaunchPad process improvement initiative are combining to deliver results in the market.In Diagnostics, excluding the impact of a ransomware attack in July and Hurricane Florence, we delivered 1.4% organic revenue and 1.9% organic volume growth. Nonetheless, this outcome was below our expectations with margin performance particularly disappointing and we are taking strong action as a result. First, we are making organizational changes to strengthen our leadership and operational performance.Second, we are launching the next phase of Diagnostics LaunchPad which will result in multiyear cost savings of a similar magnitude to LaunchPad Phase I. Applying the same principles as before, process reengineering, automation, integration of new tools and technology and facility optimization, this phase of LaunchPad will build on our prior work and lead to an even more streamlined and efficient Diagnostics business. We will provide additional detail about the size and scope of LaunchPad Phase II on our next earnings call.During the quarter, we continued to be good stewards of capital. We sharpened our life sciences focus by divesting our Food Solutions business at a very attractive valuation. As a result of the business divestiture, we exited the quarter in a strong cash position. We continued to develop our acquisition pipeline and increased share repurchases to $150 million. We are committed to supporting near and long term value creation for capital deployment, including share repurchases, internal capital investments, strategic acquisitions and debt paydown.As Glenn will explain, we expect to deploy more capital in the fourth quarter and in 2019 towards share repurchases, which we will complement with financially sound acquisitions as we continue to create shareholder value.I'll now update you on our progress on key strategic initiatives. The first strategic objective is to create a leading and differentiated consumer experience. We continue to enhance patient convenience and engagement, broaden our channel to market, and build brand loyalty.Earlier this month, following positive results and very high Net Promoter Scores at our initial 17 sites, we announced an agreement to significantly expand our LabCorp-Walgreens collaboration to at least 600 locations. Consumers, healthcare providers and managed care plans have expressed strong interest in this innovative partnership. LabCorp and Walgreens complementary healthcare expertise underpins the LabCorp-Walgreens channel, which is uniquely situated to deliver a wide range of personalized, integrated, consumer-facing services over time.Examples of additional collaboration opportunities under discussion include novel approaches to clinical research and supporting the ongoing transition to value-based care. We will begin announcing the newest LabCorp at Walgreens locations later this year.",
                 'LRCX': 'Satya KumarYes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.During today’s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment; review our financial results for the March 2018 quarter and our outlook for the June 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today’s call. Today’s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information.Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. Due to some technical difficulties, our presentation today will be audio-only and the slides accompanying today’s presentations have been posted on our website separately from the webcast.With that, let me hand the call over to Martin.Martin AnsticeAgain, thank you all for joining us today. As reported, Lam delivered strong financial results for the March 2018 quarter, with revenue, gross margin dollars and EPS all at record levels and above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, we completed our first ever quarter with over $3 billion in shipments. Including the June quarter outlook, Lam will deliver revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in 23 out of the last 24 quarters, which is a testament to both the successful scaling of our company and a multiyear environment of demand led and more sustainable customer investments. I would like to take this moment to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for the opportunity they provide us for their trust and contributions made, without which the performance of Lam would not be possible. I will keep my comments brief today given that we provided a comprehensive update on our vision, strategy and objectives at our recent Investor Day.Cost effective scaling of semiconductor device performance remains critical to addressing opportunities provided by the transition to the data economy and now is substantially more diverse in scope than traditional shrink. In this context, our focus is on systematically strengthening the competitiveness and relevance of Lam’s product portfolio to the success of our customers. Broadly recognized, etch and deposition technologies are now foundational and permanent features in the current roadmap of vertical scaling, multi-patterning, advanced packaging and advanced transistor architectures. These inflections have resulted in substantial growth in our serviceable addressable market, or SAM and reiterating a headline of the recent Investor Day, we are on track to grow our SAM to over 40% of wafer fabrication equipment spending by 2021.As an acknowledged leader in etch and deposition markets, we have an opportunity to capture a greater proportion of our customers spending by delivering unit process excellence, leveraging our multi-product capabilities and engaging in closer collaboration within the semi-ecosystem. We are making substantial comprehensive and disciplined investments in R&D to fund innovation that is intended to extend the differentiation of our products and services portfolio and we continue to prudently scale the infrastructure of the company to support our 2021 objectives.Customer equipment selection decisions in the March 2018 quarter were consistent with expectations in the context of our long-term objectives. Irrespectively, we secured additional wins in dielectric etch one for a high aspect ratio DRAM application and another for NAND flash, both at leading memory manufacturers. We also won a new nonvolatile memory application with an advanced etch capability harnessing value from our unit process excellence and unmatched collaboration between Lam etch and deposition business units. We see solid momentum with our deposition portfolio and we are pleased recently to celebrate our 500 VECTOR Strata PECVD product shipments. This platform continues to offer industry leading productivity and film property control that together creates custom enablements and competitive differentiation for Lam creating value and enhancing codependency in multi-stack deposition applications in 3D NAND for example.Our systems business is augmented by our installed base business where we have been focused on enhancing the breadths and competitiveness of our products and services as a means of further enabling our customer’s success. Customer support business unit revenue growth continued to outperform that’s of our installed base growth in the March quarter and we achieved key customer penetrations within our reliance and advanced services business. At our recent Investor Day we provided several metrics of our long-term growth not only to illustrate the value of this annuity like business, but more importantly to emphasize the integral role it plays in value creation, value capture and increasing codependency with our customers.',
                 'LW': 'Dexter CongbalayGood morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston’s third quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements about the company’s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our filings with the SEC for more details on our forward-looking statements. In addition, some of today’s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Tom will provide an overview of our performance as well as some highlights and key operational updates. Rob will then provide details on our third quarter results, our debt and cash flow and our updated fiscal 2018 outlook. Tom will wrap up with some closing remarks before opening up the call for questions.With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.Tom WernerThank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our strong quarter of sales, earnings and cash flow growth reflects the benefits of our capital expansion investments, our laser focus on delivering industry leading customer service and new product innovation in the market, and our commitment to operational excellence. Sales grew 12% driven by good balance of higher price mix and volume growth. Adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 25% to about $240 million. And through the first 9 months of the year, we generated about $310 million of cash flow from operations, up about $55 million versus the prior year period. Because of this strong performance, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2018. We now expect our sales growth rate to be at the upper end of our targeted mid single-digit range and adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to be $805 million to $810 million. Rob will provide more details on our updated outlook later on the call.Our results this quarter reflect how well our commercial and supply chain teams continued to execute on our strategic and financial objectives. But before I run through some of the highlights and key operational updates, I want to take a moment and thank all the Lamb Weston team members for the completion of our post-spin transition services with our former parent. There was a tremendous amount of heavy lifting all across our company to complete the transition on time and we did it seamlessly while continuing to drive our business results. I cannot emphasize enough how proud I am of the team.Now, moving to our key highlights for the quarter. First, our new 300 million pound French fry line in Richland, Washington is up and running providing us with much needed additional flexibility across our manufacturing network to support customer growth, innovation and service levels. Having the new line startup and run at planned levels was key to driving our strong volume growth in the quarter. I want to thank the team that brought this project to realization on time, on budget and with remarkable safety performance. Second, we have broken ground for our 300 million pound French fry line in Hermiston, Oregon. Favorable weather conditions have allowed us to accelerate the construction and we have increased CapEx spending in the near-term to reflect that. We continue to expect the new line to be operational towards the end of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And finally, our new 180 million pound facility in Russia became operational this quarter. The team there is in the process of securing customer qualification of the line and will begin ramping up production to support increasing demand in that market. As you may recall, our interest in this plant is through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture in Europe, which is a minority owner of this facility.In addition to progress on the capacity front, we have also finalized price agreements in each growing reason for the 2018 potato crop. Just like we do every year, our next step in the annual process is to enter into contracts with individual growers and we expect to complete this process relatively soon. For competitive reasons, we don’t provide many details regarding contracted potato prices and acreage requirements. Our approach to contracting raw potato supply has been and will continue to be to work with growers so that they make a fair return over and above their costs. We want to ensure that they can reinvest in their businesses and we look at these partnerships over the long-term horizon. Like many other agricultural sectors input costs whether its for seed, fertilizer, labor or capital have been rising, so it’s fair to assume that raw potato prices would increase as well. As a result, we expect our weighted average contracted per pound raw potato price to increase in the low to mid single-digit range. However, it’s really important to remember that contracted prices are only one element of understanding our total potato cost. Potato yield, quality and how they hold up in stores are all keys to determining how the potatoes perform in our production facilities and our actual costs. Much of that is not known until our fiscal second quarter. We will provide a view on total manufacturing costs when we provide our fiscal 2019 outlook in late July with appropriate updates as the year progresses.',
                 'LEG': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Watson. You may begin.Wendy WatsonGood morning and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt’s third quarter conference call.I'm Wendy Watson, Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Karl Glassman, President and CEO; Matt Flanigan, Executive Vice President and CFO; Perry Davis, EVP and President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segment; and Mitch Dolloff, EVP and President of the Furniture Products and Specialized Products segment; and Cassie Branscum, Manager of IR.The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a summary of the major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Matt will discuss financial details and address our outlook for the remainder of 2018; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material.

Actual results or events may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K and 10-Qs entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors.I'll now turn the call over to Karl Glassman.Karl GlassmanGood morning. And thank you for participating in our third quarter call.Yesterday we reported strong third quarter sales growth of 8% to $1.09 billion. Organic sales grew 6% with volume of 3%. Raw material-related selling price increases, partially offset by currency impact also added 3%. Sales growth in U.S. Spring, Automotive, Adjustable Bed, Aerospace, Steel Rod and Work Furniture was partially offset by soft demand in most other businesses. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 2% to sales growth.Third quarter earnings per share were $0.67, up $0.06 from $0.61 in third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from expanded metal margin in our Steel Rod business and increased volume. Earnings growth was partially offset by higher raw material and transportation cost in several businesses, less overhead recovery where we reduced inventory and startup costs in a few of our growing businesses. Earnings also benefited from the non-reoccurrence of last year’s $5 million impairment charge and $3 million divestiture loss, but these charges were fully offset by the non-reoccurrence of last year's divestiture-related tax benefit.Steel scrap cost, which is the primary input utilized by our rod and wire consuming businesses including U.S. Spring has been relatively stable in recent months, allowing selling price increases to catch up in certain of our businesses. As a result, EBIT margins improved sequentially from 11% in the second quarter to 11.4% in the third quarter. However, EBIT margin decreased slightly compared to the prior year's third quarter adjusted EBIT margin of 11.6%.While raw material cost increases have moderated, they are still a headwind in several of our businesses, including Home Furniture, European Spring and Flooring Products. We had another quarter of strong demand in our U.S. Spring business with Comfort Core innerspring units up 22% primarily from market share gains. We recently entered into a long-term supply agreement with Simmons Bedding and are supplying inner springs to several of their facilities.In Adjustable Bed, sales grew 27 %, however, earnings were negatively impacted by promotional activity and lower overhead absorption as we reduced inventory. Automotive growth moderated to 4% in the quarter as vehicle production slowed, particularly in Europe and Asia. With our pipeline of awarded future programs, we continue to be confident in our expectations for strong long-term performance in this business.In September, in our Geo Components business, we acquired a manufacturer and distributor of home and garden products that can be found in most major retailers. With annualized sales of $37 million, this acquisition provides a solid foundation on which to continue growing a retail – our retail market presence in Geo Components.I'll now turn the call over to Matt.Matt FlaniganThanks Karl. Good morning everyone. Cash from operations was $127 million in the third quarter, an increase of $21 million versus the third quarter last year. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12%, end of the quarter of that is. We now expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $400 million.",

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.OperatorThank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.Stuart MillerVery good and thank you. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I am here with Rick Beckwitt, Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Jaffe, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer and of course David Collins is here and you just heard from Alex Lumpkin.So, I'm going to start with a general strategic overview. Rick and Jon will give the land and operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our third quarter numbers as well as some preliminary guidance for 2019. When we get to Q&A, as always, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants.So let me go ahead and begin by saying that our once again strong quarterly results derived from a seasoned, well-coordinated operating team that is hands-on and hitting on all cylinders. With pro forma new orders up approximately 11% year-over-year and pro forma deliveries up 11.4% year-over-year, we are tracking above our own internal targets of 7% to 10% per year growth, even through the integration of the CalAtlantic merger.As the coordination of systems integration continues and synergies are run from operations, our management team and operating groups are fully engaged in making the adjustments that keep our performance industry leading and consistent.Over the past quarter, market data -- sorry about that, little technology issue.So over the past quarter, market data has sent mixed signals about the current state of the housing market in general. Sales, permits, starts and existing home sales have all shown decelerating growth rate and on their face seem to indicate slowdown. A natural mortgage application slowdown, which is normal as interest rates have trended higher and refi business dissipates, has contributed to the discourse.Generally speaking, the increases in new and exhibit -- the increases in new and existing sales prices -- home sale prices over the past years together with the general migration of interest rates upward have caused a pause in the progression of the housing recovery. Additionally, labor shortages, trade-driven material price increases and limited approved land availability have both limited production, and therefore limited supply and muted sentiment around the housing market strength and margin sustainability.This has led many to believe that the housing recovery is over or stalled. We do not agree. Instead, we believe the market has taken a natural pause, it will adjust and demand driven by fundamental economic strength will resume. Even as price increases and interest rate movements have moderated demand in the market, we believe that the housing market in the United States remains strong and is primarily driven by the deficit in production that has persisted over a decade.This production deficit defines an overall housing shortage in the country that cannot correct quickly with short labor and limited approved land. Supply of dwellings, both for sale and for rent, is short and demand remains strong, though perhaps slower and more normalized in the short term, as the market adjusts to prices and interest rates. While we clearly saw sales slow and traffic moderate during the third quarter, we feel that this is a natural pause, given the relative strength that has been in the market to date.This pause we believe is a temporary adjustment, as strong unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence and economic growth drive the consumer to catch up. Now even as market conditions fluctuate, I am increasingly enthusiastic about the evolving position of our business platform with size and market share in the best national market and as the leader in the home building industry. We're not only well positioned to execute on our current operational strategies, but we have become ever more adaptable and capable of quickly adjusting to changing landscapes around us.As a management team, we believe that we're excellently structured and positioned to continue to grow our business, while we leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and we implement new technologies to enhance bottom line and free cash flow. Given the current mismatch [Audio Gap].",

Joining me on today's call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, the President of Lilly Research Labs and our Chief Scientific Officer; Enrique Conterno, the President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A.; Christi Shaw, the President of Lilly Bio Medicines; and Anne White, who is joining us for the first time as our new President of Lilly Oncology.We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Mike Suppar (1:09), Kevin Hern, and Phil Johnson of the IR team. Please note that Jeff Simmons is not on the call today, as Elanco is now having their own quarterly earnings calls, including their first call earlier this morning. Substantive questions regarding their business performance and outlook should be directed to Elanco's Investor Relations team.During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed at the SEC. Information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional. And it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.We continued our strong performance in 2018 with a third quarter revenue growth of 7% and non-GAAP operating income of 29% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 32%. New pharmaceutical products, which now represent 35% of human Pharma revenue in the quarter, continue to be the driver of our worldwide growth, led by Trulicity, Taltz, and Verzenio.New products continue to drive strong volume-based growth, highlighted by the 14% Pharma volume growth and the 30% U.S. diabetes volume growth. We continue to expand our margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 110 basis points over Q3 2017. And non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by over 380 basis points to 28.1%.We made significant progress with the pipeline this quarter, including the approval and launch of Emgality in the U.S., a positive CHMP opinion for Emgality in Europe, the submission of lasmiditan in the U.S., as well as positive Phase 3 readouts for Ultra Rapid Lispro in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients, and a positive Phase 2 readout for GIP/GLP, which is now called tirzepatide, in Type 2 diabetes.And we announced yesterday that Trulicity demonstrated superiority in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events across a broad range of people with Type 2 diabetes in the precedent setting REWIND trial. These results are important for the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who face a higher risk for CV disease.We will submit these data to regulatory authorities and plan to present the detailed data at ADA in 2019. These extensive data, along with Trulicity's proven powerful efficacy, simply delivered, further validate Trulicity as a well-established option for people with diabetes.In terms of capital deployment, Elanco Animal Health became a publicly-traded company via a well-received initial public offering. Through the IPO and the associated debt offering, Elanco raised over $4 billion in capital, the vast majority of which was provided to Lilly as partial consideration for the Animal Health business that Lilly transferred to Elanco in connection with the IPO.We announced several business development transactions, including a licensing agreement which Chugai Pharmaceuticals for an oral GLP-1 agonist; a licensing and research collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, utilizing their RNAi technology platform; a collaboration with NextCure Inc., focused on discovery and development of novel immuno-oncology cancer therapies; and we purchased a priority review voucher.We returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we repurchased $1 billion of stock.Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see more detail on key events since our July earnings call.Now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018.Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results.Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you'll see the revenue increase of 7% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 76.7%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, gross margins as a percent of revenue increased nearly 110 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of product mix, partially offset by the negative impact of price on our revenue.",
                 'LNC': "Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends in market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to their most capable GAAP measures.Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.And I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Well, 2018 continues to be an outstanding year, as third quarter adjusted operating earnings and earnings per share were records, with EPS up 15% from the prior-year quarter. Additionally, book value per share increased 8% and return on equity was 14.5%.This quarter's strong results were also broad-based and highlight the power of our retail franchise, which brings together a comprehensive and growing product portfolio, along with expanding distribution. Targeted management actions are further enhancing our results with annuity net flows close to turning positive, group results benefiting from our Liberty acquisition, strategic investments improving expense efficiencies and future growth opportunities, and capital deployment remaining ever important.As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a negligible impact on our financials, consistent with past years. Overall, the balance sheet remains strong and the complementary nature of our businesses and sources of earnings enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow. We are returning this capital to shareholders through an active share buyback program and growth in dividends, including last night's announced 12% increase in the common stock dividend.Now, turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings results were strong as we continued to benefit from our high-quality and predictable in-force business combined with equity market tailwinds. Annuity sales were robust as our strategy of adding new products and expanding distribution continues to show meaningful progress. This quarter, new products and expanded distribution represented 39% of annuity sales.Total annuity sales increased 61% to $3.1 billion, and third quarter sales, which are typically weaker due to seasonality, improved sequentially for the first time since 2010. In addition to stronger sales, we are also getting a higher rate of return on new business, given the improving interest rate environment. Net outflows showed further improvement and totaled just $81 million in the quarter. I remain optimistic we will return to positive net flows in the fourth quarter.This quarter's variable annuity sales were strong, up 43% compared to the prior-year quarter and also broad-based, with guaranteed and non-guaranteed products and all distribution channels delivering at least 20% growth. Guaranteed VA sales increased 48%, but represented less than half of total annuity sales, highlighting the expansion and increased diversification of our product portfolio.Our newest product, Lincoln Level Advantage, an indexed variable annuity, has been our most successful product launch ever. Level Advantage sales totaled $266 million in the quarter and we continue to ramp up sales with the addition of new distribution partners. Fixed annuity sales more than doubled to nearly $200 million, resulting from significant growth in the bank and broker-dealer channels. In addition, we recently entered a new distribution channel, independent marketing organizations, and we are seeing early success.I'm also happy to announce that, in January, we will further advance our distribution strategy by entering yet another new channel, the property and casualty distribution channel via a relationship with Allstate. This relationship gives Allstate's more than 10,000 selling agents access to Lincoln's suite of fixed and variable annuity solutions. This additional scale should initially add approximately 5% to annuity sales growth. Looking forward, the sales outlook remains positive, given our strategy of significant distribution and product expansion, combined with LIMRA's forecast for industry sales growth to continue in 2019.",
                 'LKQ': "I now turn the call over to your host, Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for the call.Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. This includes statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's slide presentation.And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour.We are pleased to share both the results of our most recent quarter and the progress made on the various initiatives we have implemented since our previous call. I will provide some high-level comments, and then Varun will dig into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks.Taken as a whole, we had a very solid third quarter, and today's discussion will focus on four key things: our continued pursuit of highly profitable revenue growth, solid progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion, and adding a tool to optimize our capital allocation strategy.In reviewing our results, you will know we had excellent organic growth in global parts and services revenue and that our margins in Europe and Specialty improved compared to the third quarter of last year. While North American gross margins on a reported basis were down a bit on a year-over-year basis, they were up when removing the self-service business, which took the brunt of the negative impact of falling metals pricing during the quarter. Varun will cover this specific segment margin details shortly.Solid profits and effective working capital management led to one of the highest levels of quarterly operating cash flow in the 20-year history of the company. And with respect to capital allocation, as hopefully you all read from our press release issued this morning, I am pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program. As we stated in the release, our main priorities are to continue to both invest in the growth of our global business and de-lever the balance sheet. That said, our strong capital position and healthy cash flows afford us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers while simultaneously utilizing our share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy.Now on to the quarter. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue for the quarter was a record-high $3.12 billion, reflecting a 26.6% increase, as compared to the $2.47 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, parts and services total revenue growth was approximately 27% with organic growth of more than 4% and acquisition-related growth of approximately 23%. As mentioned over the past several quarters, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth anywhere close to this level.Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $134 million, up 9.6% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to LKQ stockholders was $177 million, an increase of 26.9% as compared to the $140 million for the same period of 2017.Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $0.42, as compared to $0.39 for the same period of last year, an increase of 7.7%. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders was a record third quarter high of $0.56 a share, a 24.4% increase, as compared to the $0.45 recorded for the same period of 2017.Let's turn to some of the segment highlights. As you will note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue growth for our North American segment grew 5.5% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of last year, with organic revenue growth for parts and services during the quarter of 5.2%, which was in line with our expectations. As noted the past few quarters, the new battery distribution agreement with FCA contributed about 150 basis points to the organic growth, so it comes with a lower margin structure as we essentially just get a service fee.",
                 'LMT': "Greg GardnerThank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Marillyn Hewson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Tanner, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.Marillyn HewsonThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call today. As today's release illustrates, we continue to outperform the goals we set at the beginning of 2018, with another quarter of strong operational accomplishments, important new business awards and outstanding financial results. We've seen strong financial performance across the entire corporation. And this performance, coupled with our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, has resulted in us updating our guidance again this quarter.I'm especially pleased to see our earnings and cash expectations continue to grow as we remain focused on operational performance and delivering long-term value to shareholders. Our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance and improved full year projections are the result of the strength provided by our broad portfolio of offerings as each of our 4 business areas contributed to our updated 2018 financial outlook.We will discuss the financials in detail a little later in the call, but I do want to highlight two key actions that our Board of Directors took this quarter in the area of cash deployment. First, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10% to $2.20 per share or $8.80 annually, maintaining our long-standing commitment to a strong dividend. Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $1 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to $3.7 billion. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to return cash to stockholders through share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit.Together, these two actions demonstrate our continued strategy of balanced cash deployment and long-term commitment to delivering returns for our stockholders. I'll cover performance highlights in just a moment, but I want to begin by noting several strategic new business awards that we received this quarter, which position us for long-term growth in our existing portfolio, as well as affording us exciting new opportunities.In August, our Lockheed Martin Space team received an initial $2.9 billion reward from U.S. Air Force for 3 next-generation missile warning satellites. These overhead persistent infrared, or OPIR, satellites build upon our legacy SBIRS spacecraft with a modernized bus and increased survivability, delivering advanced early warning and improved resiliency. We look forward to delivering these next-gen capabilities with this new opportunity. [Technical Difficulty] competitor contract of over $1.3 billion for the first two GPS follow-on satellites, with a total estimated contract value of up to $7.2 billion for 22 new GPS-IIIF spacecraft. These new GPS space vehicles are designed to provide greater accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities, providing the technology upgrades to ensure GPS-III remains the gold standard in navigation, positioning and timing.Moving to our Aeronautics business area. We secured approximately $1.7 billion in orders for 22 additional C-130J transport planes. The results of the increases included in 2017 and 2018 fiscal year omnibus appropriations legislation. These awards bring our C-130J backlog to 70 aircraft, another example of the enduring demand for this legendary platform.In Missiles and Fire Control, we were very excited to be awarded the $480 million Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW program, to provide critical design review and production readiness support for new hypersonic weapon. The ARRW contract marks our third 2018 award in this emerging technological area, and when combined with the previously announced Tactical Boost Glide and Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, or HCSW programs, brings the aggregate value of our 2018 hypersonic awards to over $1.5 billion.We were disappointed, though, at not being selected for 3 large competitive bids this quarter. We believe our proposals represented outstanding technical offerings at our lowest possible pricing. Had we matched the winning prices and been awarded the contracts, we estimate that we would have incurred cumulative losses across all three programs in excess of $5 billion, an outcome that we do not feel would have been in the best interest of our stockholders or our customers.",
                 'L': "Mary SkafidasThank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Loews Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. A copy of our earnings release, earnings supplement and company overview may be found on our website, loews.com. On the call this morning, we have our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tisch; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will have a question-and-answer session.Before we begin, however, I will remind you that this conference call might include statements that are forward looking in nature. Actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those made or implied in any forward-looking statements due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Forward-looking statements reflect circumstances at the time they are made. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is only a brief summary of the company's statutory forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included in the company's filings with the SEC.During the call today, we might also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our security filings and earnings supplement for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.In a few moments, our Chief Financial Officer, David Edelson, will walk you through the key drivers for the quarter. Before he does, Jim Tisch, our CEO, will kick off the call. Jim, over to you.James TischThank you, Mary. Today, I'd like to talk briefly about 2 things, CNA and share repurchases. CNA delivered another good quarter, thanks to strong operational results and more normalized catastrophe losses. While good quarterly results are always welcome, at Loews, we understand that there are a number of factors that can positively or negatively impact earnings. And for that reason, we focus on making decisions and running businesses for the long term, and we continue to see positive outcomes from some of the decisions made over the past decade at CNA. CNA has worked hard to strengthen its underwriting talent, improve its technology infrastructure and expand its distribution network, all while maintaining its fortress balance sheet. CNA has also actively managed the risks from its runoff, long-term care segment.On their earnings call earlier this morning, the company's CEO, Dino Robusto; and CFO, James Anderson, walked shareholders through additional details about their long-term care book of business. CNA's proactive management of this business, together with its reserve unlocking at year-end 2015, has led to several years of stable results. And at Loews, we feel great about how they've handled it. Let me hit some of the highlights that Dino and James talked about. First, the long-term care business is a closed book of business that's in the runoff mode. CNA has not written a new individual long-term care policy since 2003. And since 2015, the number of individual policyholders has decreased by 15%. Also, around 2003, CNA stopped accepting new group long-term care policies. The active lives in these group policies have declined 29% since the end of 2015. Additionally, CNA's long-term care book of business is mature. The company has processed more than 100,000 claims, which have yielded solid data that CNA is using to model reserves for the segment going forward.We are confident that CNA's long-term care reserves are built on prudent assumptions. For example, CNA's reserves assume only rate increases that CNA has already filed but have not yet been approved, or rate increases that the company plans to file in the near future as part of a current rate increase program. Beyond that, no other rate increases are assumed. At Loews, we're very interested in CNA's long-term care book of business and their active management of it. We engage with CNA regularly about the company's strategic direction for the long-term care segment as well as its reserves. And we feel confident that CNA is adequately reserved and is managing the business appropriately.And if you need more proof of how we feel about CNA, look no further than our share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2014, we have purchased about 74 million shares of Loews stock at a total cost of $3.2 billion, fully cognizant of CNA's long-term care exposure. As our largest subsidiary, CNA makes up a significant portion of the value of each Loews common share, so our buybacks underscore the confidence we feel in our insurance subsidiary's long-term value-creation power. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 5.5% of our outstanding common stock or more than 18 million shares at a total cost of about $920 million. As long-term listeners to this call know, at Lowes, we don't have an automatic share repurchase program, buying shares no matter what. We are very sensitive to the price we pay for anything, especially our shares. When we can repurchase Loews' shares at below our view of their intrinsic value, we feel that's a great use of our cash. Share buybacks remain one of the most effective ways to invest in our business while also rewarding long-term holders of the stock. Rather than complain about the prices of Loews and CNA, we recognize the gift that the markets are giving us, and we buy our shares.",
                 'LOW': "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe’s Companies third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded.During this call, management will be using certain non-GAAP financial measures. The supplemental reference slides include information about these measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Statements made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management’s expectations and opinions reflected in those statements are subject to risks, and the company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Those risks are described in the company’s earnings release and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Hosting today’s conference will be Mr. Marvin Ellison, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Bill Boltz, Executive Vice President, Merchandising; and Mr. Joe McFarland, Executive Vice President, Stores; and Mr. Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer.I will now turn the program over to Mr. Ellison for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.Marvin EllisonThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. As reflected in our earnings release earlier today, the strategic reassessment of our business continued in the third quarter. Our top priority this quarter was taking the necessary steps to build a sustainable foundation to position Lowe’s long-term success, by exiting underperforming stores of non-core businesses. This will allow us to intensify our focus on our core retail business.As part of the strategic reassessment, we made the decision to close 20 US stores and 27 stores in Canada as well as 4 other Canadian locations. We also intend to exit our retail operations in Mexico and our Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home businesses.These were difficult decisions to make, and we believe we can deliver the greatest return to our shareholders by focusing our attention on running outstanding retail businesses in US and Canada.These actions send a clear message that we’ll no longer pursue ventures that dilute our return on capital. Instead we’re committed to a more effective capital allocation process that will deliver better returns to our shareholders.I'm pleased to announce that we have substantially completed our strategic reassessment of the business, and now we can shift our attention to improving execution in our retail stores and online and, of course, we will continue to evaluate all elements of our portfolio annually.Now, let me comment on our performance in the third quarter. We delivered comparable sales growth of 1.5%, driven by a 2.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by 1% decline in transactions.Our US home improvement comp grew at 2%, with positive comps in 11 of 14 geographic regions. And as expected, the Tampa and Houston markets had the weakest comparable sales in the quarter due to tough prior-year comparisons from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We also posted 12% comp growth on lowes.com.Diluted earnings per share were $0.78 for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04, a decrease of 1% for the same period a year ago.Our third quarter results reflect many of the themes we discussed on our second quarter call. First, while we drove strong traffic to our stores and website, out of stocks continued to pressure sales.Second, our inefficient reset process continued to create disruption in our stores and contributed to out of stocks. In fact, all of our categories with negative comps, millwork, paint, fashion fixtures and flooring were pressured by poorly executed resets.Third, our store processes are too complex, our labor management system is primitive, and our associates are burdened with too many tasks. These distractions are preventing our associates from spending adequate time with the customer to provide assistance.And four, our project specialists and installed sales business is too complicated, which prevents us from delivering an outstanding customer experience and it pressures our sales.The good news is I'm pleased with the strategic initiatives the leadership team designed in Q3 to address these chronic issues. And you'll hear more about these plans later in the call. As I said earlier, our priority in the third quarter was building the sustainable foundation for long-term success. And part of the foundation for long-term success was identifying a world-class chief information officer.And earlier this month, we’re pleased to name Seemantini Godbole as our new Chief Information Officer. Seemantini is an accomplished retail executive with more than 25 years of global technology expertise and a proven track record for transforming IT and digital platformsThis is the final addition to our executive leadership team and I'm confident in her ability to help us modernize our IT and omnichannel systems.Also during the third quarter, our new leadership team assessed our functional areas, upgraded talent, conducted deeper dives in their business areas, and the team was committed to identifying the root causes of our sales per square foot challenges, merchandising reset issues, our chronic out of stock and our low job lot quantity issues. But rather than implementing quick fixes to address these chronic and long-standing issues in the third quarter, we developed plans to drive sustainable improvement. And this is reflective of our commitment of building a foundation of sustainable long-term success.",
                 'LYB': "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NVThank you, Sue.

The passcode for both numbers is 1346.During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives.That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NVAll right. Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you for participating around the world and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.Let's begin with slide 3 and review the highlights. During the third quarter, our company overcame headwinds from rising feedstock costs, global trade rebalancing, and new industry capacity. We ran our assets well and improved on 2017 profitability in four of our six segments.Year-to-date, LyondellBasell's EBITDA is nearly $250 million higher than 2017. Third quarter diluted earnings were $2.85 per share. Our results include $53 million of pre-tax charges associated with the acquisition of A. Schulman on August 21. That reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. After adjusting for transaction and integration expenses from A. Schulman and gains from an asset sale in the third quarter of 2017, our quarterly results improved by $0.55 per share relative to the prior year.During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's value-driven growth strategy achieved several milestones. We've formed the world's largest compounding company with the acquisition of A. Schulman. We launched the Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform. And, in Houston, we began construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant.We continue to evaluate a potential transaction with Braskem. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to return over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.In short, the employees of LyondellBasell are delivering on our promise of value-driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence, profitable organic expansions, accretive M&A, and generous shareholder returns.Please turn to slide 4 where we report our safety performance for the third quarter with combined A. Schulman results since August 21. The drive for excellence at LyondellBasell begins with a commitment to safety and environmental performance based on the idea that our assets, the communities in which we operate, and our more than 17,000 employees should all finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day.Our first communications with the A. Schulman employees that joined LyondellBasell in August consistently emphasized the importance of safe, injury-free operations. As we complete the fourth quarter, our team has recommitted to ourselves, our colleagues, and our families to finish strong in 2018 with another record year of improved safety performance.On slide 5 we describe the businesses that form our new Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment. APS is more than just the former A. Schulman business. The segment also includes LyondellBasell's global polypropylene compounds business from our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment to double the volume and add more than twice the EBITDA to the legacy Schulman business.We also moved nearly 1 billion pounds of premium Catalloy and polybutene-1 polymers from O&P EAI and O&P Americas to complete the new APS segment. Combined with the adjusted EBITDA of approximately $200 million reported by A. Schulman, these businesses generated approximately $640 million of EBITDA during 2017.Slide 6 provides a glimpse of how our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment extends LyondellBasell's reach into growing and attractive markets. We have grouped the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment into two business lines. The Compounding & Solutions business combines LyondellBasell's existing polypropylene compounding business, which is largely focused on automotive applications, with A. Schulman's more diverse business lines. Masterbatches, our compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging, agriculture, and durable goods applications. Engineered composites and engineered polymers add value for more specialized high-performance applications across a variety of industries. Specialty powders are largely used to mold toys, industrial tanks, and sporting goods such as kayaks. Performance colors provide powdered, pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry.",
                 'MTB': 'Don MacLeodThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to thank you all for participating in M&T’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.Also, before we start, I’d like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.Now, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.Darren KingThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone.We were quite pleased with M&T’s results for the third quarter, which we characterized as strong in this morning’s press release. Some highlights from the quarter include continued growth in net interest income, both on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis; fee revenues that remained steady with softness in mortgage banking and trust income seasonality being offset by higher commercial loan fees; well-controlled expenses, notwithstanding the steps we’re taking to invest some of the savings from tax reform into higher compensation for certain employees; and credit performance that is stable to a point beyond our expectations with the current run-rate of credit losses benefitting from a sizable recovery this quarter. These higher levels of profitability, both preprovision and aftertax afford M&T many opportunities to deploy capital, including through the return of capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 25% to $1 per share per quarter and repurchased nearly $500 million of M&T common stock.Now, let’s look at the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.53 for the third quarter of 2018, improved from $3.26 in the second quarter of 2018 and $2.21 in the third quarter of 2017.Net income for the quarter was $526 million, up from $493 million in the linked quarter and $356 million in the year ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T’s third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.8% and an annualized return on average common equity of 14.08%. This compares with rates of 1.70% and 13.32% respectively in the previous quarter.Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $5 million or $0.03 per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.M&T’s net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $531 million, up from $498 million in the linked quarter and $361 million in last year’s third quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.56 for the recent quarter, up from $3.29 in 2018 second quarter and $2.24 in the third quarter of 2017. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders’ equity of 1.89% and 21% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.79% and 19.91% in the second quarter of 2018.In accordance with the SEC’s guidelines, this morning’s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP including tangible assets and equity. As a reminder, the year-over-year comparisons for both GAAP and net operating earnings are impacted by the reduction in the federal income tax rates for 2018 and beyond with M&T’s effective tax rate for the first three quarters of 2018 some 12 percentage points lower in 2017.Recall that both GAAP and net operating earnings for the third quarter of 2017 were impacted by a non-deductible $44 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice that related to matters at Wilmington Trust Corporation prior to its acquisition by M&T and a $50 million addition to M&T’s reserve for litigation matters. Net of tax impacts, these actions reduced net income by $48 million or $0.31 of diluted earnings per common share in that quarter. GAAP pretax income in the recent quarter improved by 10% from the year-ago quarter, excluding the prior year’s increase to the reserve litigation.Turning to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.03 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up $20 million from the previous quarter. The comparison with the prior quarter reflects an expansion of net interest margin to 3.88%, up 5 basis points from 3.83% in the linked quarter, combined with the impact from one additional accrual day in the recent quarter. The primary driver of the wider net interest margin was the further increase in short-term interest rates arising from the Fed’s June and September rate actions, lifting overall asset yields. A big difference between this quarter and the prior two was the relationship between the Fed funds rate and short-term LIBOR. That spread widened to a lesser extent than in recent quarters, resulting in a margin improvement, consistent with our previous estimates.',
                 'MAC': "Good day, and welcome to the Macerich Company Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Wood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jean WoodReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's website at macerich.com.Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Doug Healey, Executive Vice President, Leasing; and Scott Kingsmore, Senior Vice President, Finance.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.Tom O'HernThanks, Jean. The third quarter reflected generally good operating results as evidenced by the strength of most of our portfolios, key metrics, including an improvement in same-center net operating income growth.As we've mentioned several times at our last calls that bankruptcies and early terminations in 2017 tempered our growth in the first half of 2018, as we work through leasing up that space. Most of that space has been re-leased by September 30, as is evidenced by our 95% occupancy rate. We continue to see an improving leasing environment with strong retailer sales, far fewer bankruptcies, and a much more positive tone from the retailer community.Looking at results of operations for the quarter, FFO was $0.99 per share, which compared favorably to our guidance of $0.97, and exceeded the $0.96 reported in the third quarter of last year. Quarter-end occupancy was 95.1%, up 80 basis points from last quarter, and up 80 basis points from September 30, 2017.Same-center net operating income including lease termination revenue was up 3.7% for the quarter. Excluding lease termination, revenue same-center was up 3.1%. As we indicated on the last earnings call, we expected to see this acceleration same-center in the second half of 2018. We also expect the fourth quarter to exceed 3%. The property gross operating margin improved by 80 basis points to 69.4%, up from 68.6% last year at the third quarter.Now looking at the Sears bankruptcy and its impact on us, we have a total of 21 Sears Stores. That is significantly less than the 40 Sears locations we had in 2012. As a result of our disposition program over the past six years, we have reduced our Sears exposure by nearly 50%. The average building size is 150,000 square feet, and our parcel size that ranges from 10 acres to 20 acres. The Sears bankruptcy was long expected and represents a great opportunity for us to improve our high quality portfolio both in terms of tenant quality, sales productivity, traffic, and densification. Redevelopment, we have recently completed at Kings Plaza is a great example of that.The Sears boxes can be categorized into three different ownership groups. The first is nine of the Sears stores are owned 50/50 and a joint venture with Seritage. Seven of those nine are on the closure list; the other two Danbury and Freehold have already been 50% converted by virtue of putting Primark in those locations. These stores are at some of our best malls. That group has an average sales per foot of $780 per square foot. We have plans for all of these locations with a range of opportunities including demolishing the box and repurposing the square footage with more productive uses, including mixed-use and densification. In certain locations, we will be redemising the existing box and putting in more productive retail uses that will generate significantly more rent, sales and traffic than Sears provided.The second group of stores, we have seven locations that are owned by us and leased to Sears for a very nominal rent. One of those locations is already closed, and the others are not on the closure list and it is not clear at this time what Sears' intentions are with those stores. These locations if closed will allow us the opportunity to replace the non-productive department store box with a more productive traffic generating use. The last group of the stores, the five stores that are not owned by us, four of which are owned by Seritage, one is owned by Sears. And one of the locations is closed and two of the Seritage-owned stores are on the closure list.A number of you have asked about co-tenancy issues if Sears closes all of their stores. At 11 of our centers we have zero co-occupancy exposure. At the other 10, the amount is immaterial in total about a $0.01 a share if all those locations close. Of the 16 locations that we have ownership positions in and we would estimate our pro rata share of the capital requirements to redevelop those to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million spend over the course of the next three to four years.

                 'M': 'I would now like to turn the call over to Monica Koehler, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead.Monica KoehlerGreat. Thank you. Good morning.

We look forward to taking your questions after our prepared remarks.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff GennetteSo, thank you, Monica. So, good morning, everybody and thanks for joining the call. As you saw in our press release this morning, Macy’s delivered a strong third quarter with comparable sales up 3.3% on an owned plus licensed basis and earnings of $0.27 per share. We saw strong results across the Macy’s Inc. business with Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, all performing well in the quarter which contributed to our solid topline growth.Based on the third quarter results, we are raising the annual earnings guidance by $0.15 and adjusting the range of sales guidance. Paula will give you more details on the quarter and our remarks -- and our outlook in her remarks.So Macy’s recipe for success is e-commerce, healthy stores and a great mobile experience that ties it all together. It is our competitive moat. Our e-commerce business just completed another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by continued improvement to our online offering and experience.We invested early in mobile and our mobile app just keeps getting better. We view the Macy’s app as our customer’s indispensable shopping companion and increasingly it’s becoming a channel for transactions as well. This year we will hit $1 billion in mobile sales.The growth of our digital business goes hand-in-hand with the growth of our brick-and-mortar business. We have seen the trend improvement in our stores beginning a year ago and we have seen steady quarter-to-quarter progress throughout the year.This is important, because healthy brick-and-mortar -- healthy brick-and-mortar business is part of our strategy to build lifetime value with our existing customers and to bring new customers into the brand. I am going to give you a brief update on our strategic initiatives and then Paula will take you through the details of the quarter and then we are going to open up the line for your questions.So as we noted on our last call, the third quarter was an important time for us as we were laying the groundwork for our strategic initiatives. That work is complete and we are fully prepared for the critical holiday season ahead.As you know, we have five strategic initiatives in 2018 and let me touch on each of them. Loyalty, we recently marked the one year anniversary of our new loyalty program and I am pleased to say that the program is delivering the results we anticipated.Our platinum customers who are our best customers are spending more with us and shopping more frequently. They like the simplicity and value of the new program. We had a great response to the exclusive experiences that we have been able to offer the platinum card holders.Because we have a well-developed entertainment and events business, Macy’s has a unique portfolio of experiences to pull from and to offer our platinum card holders. This includes exclusive access to our iconic events like the upcoming Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, like concerts, fashion shows, cooking classes to name a few.While the first priority of our loyalty program is to take care of our existing best customers, we have now expanded the program with a new tender neutral tear, which we launched earlier this year. We call this the Bronze Program and the Bronze Program is showing strong early results and we have added nearly 2 million new members to the loyalty program. So overall, we are very pleased with the loyalty program. It’s bringing new customers into the brand and increasing the lifetime value of our best customers.',
                 'MRO': "I will now turn the call over to Guy Baber, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.Guy Allen Baber - Marathon Oil Corp.Thanks, Christine, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release, slide presentation, and investor packet that address our third quarter results. These documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our President and CEO, Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO, Mitch Little, Executive VP of Operations, and Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy.As always, today's call will contain forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials, as well to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee, who'll provide his opening remarks. We will then open the call to Q&ALee M. Tillman - Marathon Oil Corp.Thanks, Guy, and thanks again to everyone joining us this morning. Third quarter was once again highlighted by differentiated operational execution across our multi-basin portfolio, underscored by our unwavering commitment to capital discipline. It is this foundation that is leading the delivery against our major strategic priorities, compelling improvement in corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share, organic free cash flow generation, ongoing resource capture and enhancement, and additional return of capital to shareholders.Specifically, for the third quarter in a row, we have again raised our guidance for annual improvement in both corporate cash return on invested capital and cash flow per debt adjusted share. And with no change to our original $2.3 billion development capital program, we have raised our annual resource play oil and boe production growth guidance for the third consecutive quarter. We began this year by budgeting on a conservative price outlook of $50 WTI. And as oil prices have outperformed our plan, we have remained disciplined and we have maintained our focus on differentiated execution. Our capital budget is not a suggestion. It is a commitment upon which we must deliver. We are not chasing higher prices by ramping our spending, rather through superior execution and capital efficiency, we are driving meaningful corporate returns improvement and are delivering significant free cash flow for our shareholders. This is our model for 2018, for 2019, and in the future.Our organic free cash flow generation during third quarter was robust at $320 million bringing the year-to-date total to over $630 million. This coupled with our peer leading balance sheet further enhances our financial flexibility and allows us to support an all of the above strategy that balances enhanced return of cash to shareholders with low-cost, high-return resource capture. And we are confident that we will continue to successfully accomplish both objectives in the current environment.All of uses of capital are tested against our returns-first orientation. And with our shares trading at a discount, we have now repurchased $500 million of our own stock this year leaving $1 billion of buyback authorization outstanding. This supplements our already peer competitive quarterly dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $600 million to our shareholders through the combination of our dividend and share repurchases.Looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and thoughtful with our approach to future stock buyback activity. Our actions will continue to be guided by our focus on returns and our pace governed by our sustainable organic free cash flow generation.We have also maintained our focus on resource capture and enhancement, primarily through three complimentary efforts, organic core extension in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, small bolt-on acquisitions and trades such as in the Northern Delaware with the recent BLM lease sale, and our resource play exploration program. We recently spud our first exploration well in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play with results expected in 2019. This multipronged approach provides a sustainable framework for ongoing resource base improvement with a focus on full cycle returns and without the need for any large scale M&A.Recognizing that M&A has been very topical recently, our extensive portfolio transformation that has created a differentiated position in the four best U.S. resource plays means the hard work on our portfolio is behind us. We are now capturing the advantages of our multi-basin model and are focused on execution at scale. Large scale M&A is not a consideration nor is it required for our future success.So let's turn our attention to some of the numerous highlights for third quarter and not surprisingly, excellence in execution was again our primary theme. We exceeded the high end of our total company and resource play production guidance while our development CapEx declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. In the Eagle Ford, our asset team continues to set the standard, where our capital efficient execution and advantage pricing are driving some of the best financial returns in our industry.",
                 'MPC': "I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.Kristina KazarianWelcome to Marathon Petroleum's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team.We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.Gary HemingerThanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row. Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter. During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first three years. Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.",
                 'MAR': "Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead, sir.Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.I should note that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, November 6, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold.In our discussion today about the income statement, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, reimbursed revenues, and related expenses, the year-to-date net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the year-to-date adjustment to the Avendra gain. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks at www.marriott.com/investor.So, let's get started. We are now past the second anniversary of our acquisition of Starwood and just last week, we met with our North American owners at a largely upbeat Full-Service Owners Conference.When we announced our intention to acquire Starwood in 2015, our hotel owners were supportive and upon completion of the deal remain so. They have provided great feedback throughout the process as we set our priorities for the integration. Today they are now reaping the benefits from improved cost efficiencies, higher guest satisfaction, and the upcoming impact of a more powerful loyalty program.Over those last two years we have integrated our operations, sales, marketing, hotel development, and finance organizations and systems. We are halfway through moving legacy Starwood hotels on to our Marriott reservations platform and the process is going very well.We've enhanced guest satisfaction by applying Marriott's deep operational know-how and made solid progress on product scores. Costs for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood hotels have been reduced as we captured synergy cost savings at properties, reduced loyalty program charge-out rates across the system, and realized procurement savings. We also lowered corporate, general, and administrative expenses meaningfully.After two years of planning, we integrated our loyalty programs on August 18, creating one powerful unified program allowing our members to earn, book, and redeem across more than 6,700 hotels. This was an extremely complicated systems challenge as we essentially created a new loyalty platform.While there are always unanticipated challenges with complex systems integrations, our loyalty and IT teams were driven to make this integration go as smoothly as possible. In the days following cutover, many loyalty members checked their online statements and some discovered errors. Telephone volume to our loyalty lines increased running up 35% at the peak. Our team immediately identified the problems and our loyalty telephone agents were quickly trained to help customers with these issues.To be sure, wait times were sometimes too high. Today call volume to our loyalty lines is running roughly 2% to 3% over seasonal norms and wait times are back to normal. While we have solved the most significant problems, we are still addressing issues for some customers. For those loyalty members who were affected we appreciate your patience. One powerful learning from this aspect of the integration, we discovered just how passionate our members are about our loyalty program.We are already seeing the positive results from the loyalty integration. Our total loyalty membership is now 120 million members. Post-program integration data reveals accelerated bookings from loyalty members, higher luxury redemptions and a growing proportion of bookings from our direct digital channels.Notwithstanding our focus on integration over the last two years, we have not stood still. We entered into a joint venture with Alibaba in Asia, introduced a pilot of Tribute Portfolio homes in Europe, introduced new loyalty credit cards with JPMorgan Chase and American Express, expanded our mobile offerings to include food and beverage at hotels and began taking cruise reservations for the first Ritz-Carlton yacht.Beginning in 2019, we are implementing a new program services fee structure for owners that will allow us to manage cost for programs and services in a manner that is simple and predictable. Under this new structure, we expect over three-quarters of hotels will see costs for these programs and services decline.Our new Enhanced Reservation System which we call ERS has been rolled out to over 500 hotels. ERS allows guests to select rooms based on a greater variety of room characteristics such as bed type, view, high or low floor, corner room balcony, and so on with more photography and hotel descriptions allowing greater customer choice and more effective marketing.Earlier this year, we reduced intermediary commissions for group business from 10% to 7%. Our largest competitors have followed albeit months after us which may have permitted them to temporarily benefit from some customer shift. While not all group business is intermediated, these commissions have been a significant and growing cost for large group hotels.Group meeting customers choose our hotels because of our high-quality service, outstanding rooms and meeting space, and reasonable cost. Over the last 12 months our group RevPAR index is steady. And in the third quarter RevPAR at our largest group hotels in North America rose 3%.In revenue management, we are focused on profitability as well as RevPAR. As a measure RevPAR is easy to understand readily available in weekly STR reports, but is a blunt instrument for measuring success. Some distribution channels are just too expensive for the value of the business they deliver.In North America, our revenue management systems now consider these distribution costs when deciding which channels to open on any particular night. This has resulted in a decline in OTA business during peak occupancy nights and an increase in direct bookings.On a worldwide basis OTA share of our room nights was flat year-over-year in the third quarter and declined in North America. We believe this likely had a few tenths negative impact on RevPAR growth, but a favorable impact on hotel profits.Global RevPAR rose roughly 2% in the third quarter with a modest increase in North America and continued robust trends in most international markets. We expect global RevPAR will increase roughly 2% in the fourth quarter and based on our early budget work 2% to 3% for the full year 2019.",
                 'MMC': "I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter who is dialing in from London; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell, Head of Investor Relations. The third quarter was eventful for Marsh & McLennan. I am pleased with our overall financial results for the quarter and I will talk about them a bit later. Without a doubt, the major highlight of the third quarter was our agreement to acquire Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group. We are progressing with the regulatory and shareholder approval process.In the U.S., we recently received antitrust regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, concluding the competition review of both the FTC and Department of Justice. Also, JLT has announced it will hold a General Meeting of Shareholders on November 7 for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval. As we move forward, the transaction remains subject to additional antitrust and regulatory approvals. At this point, we expect closing sometime in the spring of next year. Our executive committee spent last week in London getting to know the senior leadership of JLT better as well as addressing the broader JLT colleague base through a large town hall meeting. There is tremendous energy and optimism on both sides around the benefits this acquisition will bring to clients, colleagues and shareholders. Following these meetings, I am even more excited about the strategic potential for our combined organization.The process of planning our future together has begun in earnest. Teams of leaders from both organizations are involved in this effort and decisions will be made from the perspective of bringing the best of both. While JLT is a large transaction for us, we have a strong track record of M&A having executed nearly 160 transactions since the beginning of 2009. Over that time, we have had success in retaining key talent and maintaining the unique qualities of the organizations we acquire. While no integration is seamless, the combined leadership team has the depth of experience and industry knowledge to grasp the challenges ahead and execute successfully. As I have said previously, this is a combination out of strength on both sides. It is about one thing, growth, growth in talent, capabilities, revenues, margins, and earnings.Dominic Burke and the JLT management team have built a terrific organization that is highly skilled with a strong track record of growth. Together, we'll deliver even more value for clients. It further solidifies our position as the leading global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We will have the broadest and deepest talent in the industry. Marsh McLennan will be the single-best place to work, the employer of choice and the organization where creative and highly-skilled people will optimize their talent. We will have a relentless focus on clients and improving the client experience. The strength of our combined organization and the unmatched capabilities we bring will be the driving force for client and colleague satisfaction.We will have deeper industry expertise, stronger geographic positioning, and greater capacity for investments in digital, data and analytical capabilities, which will benefit our clients. We will be out in front of their greatest challenges with innovation and thought leadership. In addition to the JLT news, we had an active M&A quarter on other fronts. During the quarter, Mercer announced the acquisitions of Pavilion Financial Group and Summit Strategies Group within the Wealth division. These transactions, which represent approximately $90 million of combined revenues will strengthen Mercer's investment consulting position in the endowment, healthcare and insurance sectors while adding capabilities in alternative investments. Both firms bring high-quality talent as evidenced by their strong scores in the Greenwich Associates Quality Index for investment consulting.",
                 'MLM': "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.Suzanne Osberg - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available, during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q3 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.As detailed on slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise.We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for third quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue.Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses, the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting, and restructuring charge. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2018 supplemental information and SEC filing.We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance as well market trends heading into 2019. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow.I will now turn the call over to Ward.C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta continues to benefit from an improving construction cycle and the strength of our operational performance. We achieved record third quarter revenues, gross profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and diluted earnings per share. And we delivered these impressive results while successfully managing near-term challenges from historically high levels of precipitation.We estimate weather negatively impacted third quarter profitability by $40 million to $45 million. Importantly, as noted in today's earnings release, we remain on course to once again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year and are well-positioned for continued growth in 2019.We're confident that the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets and a wide range of factors support steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing in the near-to-medium term.Specifically, for the third quarter, in July and August, we experienced more manageable weather patterns. Consistent with our internal expectations, aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete shipments meaningfully accelerated and pricing also improved. These trends highlight the attractive demand environment across our geographic footprint, particularly in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa and are wholly consistent with our broader expectations.In September, we experienced extraordinary weather, including Hurricane Florence and record Texas rainfall pausing the third quarter's earlier momentum which is typically our industry's busiest and most profitable period. These notable disruptions impacted more than half of our Building Materials business as measured by revenues. Regardless of underlying market strength, Mother Nature can temporarily interrupt construction activity.Hurricane Florence made landfall in Eastern North Carolina not far from the South Carolina border. This event affected at least 15 of September's 19 selling days as the region was either preparing for, enduring and/or cleaning up from the storm. Indeed this unusually slow-moving storm produced torrential rainfall and widespread inland flooding throughout the Carolinas, leaving an estimated $17 billion of damage and over 18 trillion gallons of water in its wake. That's enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay. And 10 billion gallons of it filled our Castle Hayne and Belgrade quarries in Eastern North Carolina.While Texas was not affected by Hurricane Florence, the state experienced its wettest September in the last 124 years. Dallas/Fort Worth had nearly 13 inches of rain during the month, while San Antonio received nearly 17 inches of rain, almost 14 inches above normal. Texas is our largest state by revenues. With aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete operations throughout the Texas Triangle, the negative financial impact of September's record rain fall was considerably more significant than both Hurricane Florence and last year's Hurricane Harvey combined.",
                 'MAS': "I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.David Chaika - Masco Corp.Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2018 third quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at 313-792-5500.Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We describe these risk and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted measurements to GAAP in our earnings release and the presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.Keith J. Allman - Masco Corp.Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide 4. In the third quarter, our top line increased 9% excluding the impact of currency, driven by strong growth in our North American Plumbing operations, our Cabinet business and our acquisition of Kichler Lighting earlier this year. Excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 4%. Operating profit grew $10 million and we achieved 15.2% operating margin in the quarter due to higher volume, price and disciplined cost control. Our EPS increased 25% to $0.65 per share.Turning to our segment performance, our Plumbing segment grew 4% or 5% in local currency, driven by outstanding North American Plumbing growth of 9%. Delta had a record sales quarter with strong growth across all channels and price points. Our upper price point Brizo products, our entry-level Peerless products, bathing fixtures and toilets, all experienced strong growth. Additionally, Watkins continued its strong performance due to model refreshes in its dealer channel and an expanded product offering in the retail channel. While North American Plumbing was strong this quarter, international Plumbing declined 1% in local currency, primarily due to softness in Central Europe. This was partially offset by continued strength in China.In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 20%. Excluding our acquisition of Kichler Lighting, sales grew 1%, with high single-digit growth in pro paint and strong performance in decorative hardware, largely offset by a decline in DIY paint. While the DIY paint market was softer than expected, we believe our competitive advantage of having the highest quality, best value paint sold exclusively at The Home Depot positions us well.Moving on to Cabinetry, our Cabinet segment delivered robust 11% growth excluding the divestiture of Moores. This growth was led by our repair and remodel business in both the retail and dealer channels. The roll-out and initial months of the Menards program have gone well, and we are on plan to achieve an $80 million annual sales run rate during the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with our top line performance in Cabinetry, we experienced slightly unfavorable mix as we ramped up the Menards business and experienced an increase in logistics costs, both of which will likely continue into the fourth quarter.Turning to Windows, sales were down 3% mostly due to the difficult 12% comp in our U.S. business and softness in the UK market. Moving to capital allocation, we continued our share repurchase activity in the quarter by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for approximately $89 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase total to $354 million. Based on current market conditions and our liquidity, we now plan to allocate up to $300 million to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our expected 2018 share repurchase total to approximately $650 million.This share repurchase activity is in addition to the $550 million allocated to the Kichler acquisition and the $114 million allocated to debt reduction, demonstrating our strong free cash flow generation and balanced capital allocation strategy. Lastly, we are updating our anticipated earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.39 to $2.44. This is largely due to the lower than expected volumes in our DIY coatings and international Plumbing businesses and modestly lower margin expectations for Cabinetry.",
                 'MA': "Thank you. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.Thank you, Denise. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. Please note that due to our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan entity starting this year, we are providing additional information regarding our switched transaction and card growth rates. The adjusted growth rates eliminate Venezuelan switched transactions and card counts from prior periods so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted growth rates. These are the only supplemental operational metrics which are significantly impacted by the deconsolidation.Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.Thanks, Warren, and good morning, everybody. Strong performance continued this quarter. We had revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 36% versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items. But if you further exclude the impact of the accounting changes that affect year-over-year comparisons, our underlying net revenue growth was 14% and our operating income increased by 19%. I think these results reflect our operational focus, our market share growth, and I think strong underlying business fundamentals while we continue to invest in the business for the longer term.So let's start with the macroeconomic environment. We continue to see solid overall growth, although just like others, we are keeping an eye out for potential impacts related to fiscal stimulus reductions, rising interest rates, and possibly increased trade barriers, which could slow global economic growth. In addition, we are monitoring the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on cross-border flows and the economic weakness in some emerging market countries.In the U.S., economic growth remains positive. Low unemployment, healthy consumer confidence helped. Our SpendingPulse estimate for Q3 showed retail sales remained strong and were actually up 5.2% ex-auto, ex-gas versus a year ago. Businesses are investing, and the provisional agreement on a new trade deal in North America is good news both in terms of the stability it will provide for companies as they plan their supply chains and due to some of the specific terms that it includes that we believe will be beneficial to our industry.Overall conditions in Europe remain stable. Unemployment continues to decline. Consumer confidence remains strong in areas such as the Nordics while I think there are political concerns there in countries – some of them, including the UK, Italy and Turkey. In Latin America, the elections in Brazil and Mexico are now behind us, and the real and peso recovered somewhat, although yesterday was not a great day for the peso. At this stage, we are waiting to see how the economic and fiscal policy agendas develop as these new administrations take office.We're also monitoring a few potential headwinds in Asia. Although consumer sentiment remains relatively positive, trade tensions are weighing on business sentiment, most notably in China and Japan and Korea.Against that backdrop, we are driving healthy double-digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets, with momentum across our core products and services. And let me, as usual, give you a few examples.First, we have expanded our existing relationship with HSBC, including winning new business in the UK, Hong Kong, and Mexico. And like many of our customers, HSBC will now also leverage Mastercard Labs' rapid prototyping capabilities along with Mastercard Advisors and our data and analytics services to help optimize their portfolios.",
                 'MAT': 'I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Whitney Steininger with Investor Relations. Ma\'am, you may begin.Whitney Steininger - Mattel, Inc.Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\'s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel\'s Chief Financial Officer.As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel\'s 2018 third quarter financial results. We will begin today\'s call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard and Joe to take your questions.To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and constant currency.Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.Before we begin, I\'d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2018 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.Now, I\'d like to turn the call over to Ynon.Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.Thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter earnings call. I\'m happy to say we are on track with the execution of our strategy and have made meaningful progress towards restoring profitability as we transform Mattel into an IP-driven, high-performing toy company.During the third quarter, gross sales were down 6% as reported and 4% in constant currency, primarily due to a negative 3% impact from Toys "R" Us and a negative 3% impact from the slowdown in our China business.At the same time, gross sales in North America were up 6%, which is the highest sales growth we\'ve had in this key market for 11 quarters. Importantly, we have achieved profitability in the quarter as a result of savings realized from our Structural Simplification program, as well as a net benefit related to Toys "R" Us bankruptcy accounting. As a result, reported operating income was up 41% versus the same period last year, which is the first time in eight quarters that we have posted year-over-year growth in operating income.These results were achieved in spite of increased inflation in the cost of raw materials and plant labor. We are proud to say that we recaptured the position of the number one global toy company in each of the last four months through September, according to NPD. We\'re also the number one toy company in the U.S. and Latin America year-to-date through September.We continued to make tangible progress in reshaping our organization. We are on track to achieve or exceed our $650-million savings target for Structural Simplification. In addition, we\'re actively exploring strategic alternatives for our manufacturing footprint as we move towards a capital-light model, which could lead to additional efficiencies over time.We also have taken meaningful steps to drive future growth. This includes the creation of a new theatrical film division and a global franchise management organization to capitalize on our iconic brands and IP. We saw particular strength in Barbie, Jurassic World and Games and are positioned well going into the holiday season.In terms of performance by brand, in the third quarter, Barbie continued its strong momentum with growth across all regions. Barbie gross sales were up 17% in constant currency. This makes the fourth consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year sales growth for the brand. POS continue to be strong and was up high-single digits.Barbie sales in North America and International were up 22% and 11% respectively, in constant currency. Reinforcing these strong results, Barbie was the number one global fashion doll property year-to-date through September according to NPD. We expect to see continued momentum for Barbie in the fourth quarter and look forward to her 60th Anniversary in 2019.',
                 'MKC': 'ntationKasey JenkinsDuring our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Please refer to our presentation which includes the complete information. As a reminder, today’s presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statements also provide information on Risk Factors that could affect our financial results.It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.Lawrence KurziusThank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results continued the strong performance we delivered in the first-half of 2018, and we’re well-positioned to deliver strong full-year results. We’ve driven strong double-digit sales, operating profit and EPS growth, as well as significant operating margin expansion in both the third quarter and year-to-date. These results reflect the effectiveness of our sales and profit growth strategies, driven by the engagement of our employees around the world.Starting on Slide 4, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, which we are continuing to grow. Among the third quarter highlights across our portfolio, in our Consumer segment’s underlying business, we drove growth in the Americas, particularly in recipe mixes and spice and seasonings, and we continued our momentum in China.In our Flavor Solutions segment, we continued winning with customers, driving base business and new product growth in both the Americas and EMEA. We also continue to make progress on expanding our portfolio with additional growth and more flavors, while pruning some low-margin business. The reshaping of our Flavor Solutions portfolio is a significant driver of operating margin expansion.In addition to the solid growth in our core business, we’re pleased with Frank’s and French’s performance and their positive impact on our portfolio of condiments and sauces and branded foodservice. Overall, we are confident that the breadth and reach of our portfolio continues to position us to fully meet the demand for flavor around the world and grow our business.Now let me go into more detail on our third quarter performance on Slide 5, as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to Mike, who’ll go in more depth on the quarter-end results and discuss our updated 2018 financial guidance.Starting with our top line for the third quarter, we grew sales 14% for the total company with minimal impact from currency. This was driven by strong results from both segments, led by the Americas. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions are three drivers of long-term sales growth are all contributing factors.Our base business and new product growth accelerated from our first-half sales growth, as we said we would in our June call. Incremental sales from our acquired Frank’s and French’s brands contributed 10%.In our Consumer segment, we grew sales 14% with minimal impact from currency, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, we grew 14% in constant currency. The growth in both segments was led by incremental Frank’s and French’s sales, which contributed 10% to our Consumer segment and 9% to our Flavor Solutions segment.In addition to our top line growth, our focus on profit realization drove additional adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating margin expansion. With our higher sales, cost savings, led by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, or CCI, and our portfolio shift to more value-added products, including the addition of Frank’s and French’s, we grew the third quarter’s adjusted operating income 20% in constant currency, with both segments contributing double-digit growth. And we expanded our adjusted operating margin 80 basis points, while making significant investments in brand marketing.We are achieving the margin accretion we expected from the Frank’s and French’s portfolio. And equally as important, we are driving significant margin expansion in our core business, led by CCI, as well as the shift in our portfolio to more value-added products.At the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 was 14% higher than $1.12 in the third quarter of 2017. Our strong growth and adjusted operating income and more favorable tax rate drove this increase, partially offset by higher interest expense from debt related to the RB Foods acquisition, as well as higher shares outstanding. The 14% earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency.',
                 'MXIM': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kathy Ta, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kathy.Kathy Ta - Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome everyone, to Maxim Integrated's fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Tunç Doluca; and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Kiddoo.I would like to highlight that we have posted a supplemental financial presentation to our external Investor Relations website. The information in this presentation accompanies the financial disclosures in our earnings press release and on this conference call.During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I'd like to remind you that these statements must be considered in conjunction with the cautionary warnings that appear in our SEC filings. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this call involve risks and uncertainty and that future events may differ materially from the statements made. For additional information, please refer to the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings which are posted on our website.Now, I'll turn the call over to Tunç.Tunç Doluca - Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. This quarter, Maxim is celebrating the 35-year anniversary of the company's founding. Over the last 3.5 decades, we have built a durable business through our expertise in high-performance analog, particularly in power management products.We have built a strong brand with our customers in solving their toughest problems. I really believe Maxim has one of the finest engineering teams in analog in the world. And our customers tell us that the performance of our products is what sets us apart from our competitors and what gives us lasting differentiation in each of our end markets.Let me now turn to this quarter's results. As a reminder, during last year's June quarter, we transitioned one of our U.S. distributors to sell-in accounting. During our commentary today, we will exclude that component of revenue from the June quarter of last year.We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew strongly, driven by our power management products in Consumer, Automotive and Industrial with continued solid profitability. Looking forward, we continue to expect significant growth drivers in Automotive, Industrial and Data Center.First, I will comment on Automotive. We continue to see strong demand in battery management systems, or BMS, especially in China. In the March quarter, we introduced a high current version of our BMS product designed for electric buses. This product has already earned a significant new design win in China. On a year-over-year basis, our Automotive design wins continue to grow in the double-digits. This growth is led by power, battery management and serial link products, giving us confidence in year-over-year revenue growth in the low teens in Automotive.Quality and safety are paramount to Automotive customers. Automotive safety certifications, called ASIL levels, address potential hazards that can occur when electrical systems in cars malfunction. It covers the entire automotive safety lifecycle, from management, development, production, operation, service and decommissioning of an electrical system.Maxim has the highest-rated ASIL compliant battery management system in the industry, and our ASIL ratings in power management and serial link interface products differentiate us in the market as well. These safety certifications become increasingly important to our customers as driver-assist content continues to grow. This higher safety trend plays to our strengths in product design for Automotive.In the March quarter, Automotive grew in the double digits from the same quarter last year. In the June quarter, we expect strong sequential growth, driven by power management products for infotainment, continued momentum in our battery management system business and ADAS products. In fact, in the June quarter, we expect high-teens year-over-year growth in Automotive.Let me next turn to the Industrial market. Our March quarter Industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year. Within Industrial, the core segment led our year-over-year growth, driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical and by progress we made in our broad market initiatives. We also closed a small acquisition in the industrial communications area.In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be strongly up, sequentially, and up in the mid-teens compared to the same period last year. This performance is again expected to be led by factory automation products and through our strategy to reach small and medium business customers with distribution partners.",

Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?Steve EasterbrookThanks Mike. Good morning.With another solid performance in the third quarter, we remain confident in our business as we continue to execute an aggressive and holistic growth strategy. We are making substantial progress in modernizing restaurants around the world, enhancing hospitality and innovating the experience for more than 60 million customers we serve every day.As a result, we have achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of global comparable sales growth of our increasing top-line, traffic share and guest counts in most of our top markets. During the third quarter, most of our largest international markets continue to drive momentum in our business. Canada has been on the 10-year run of success. In August, I was in Vancouver to meet with the local leadership team, and we visited the first McDonald's restaurant open in Canada.It was recently modernized and we could see the digital menu boards, the refresh décor, McCafe bakery displays and other improvements making such a noticeable change to McDonald's customers. Like many of our top performing markets Canada is excelling at the fundamentals of running great restaurants.The crew members continue to set some of the highest standards of hospitality in the McDonald's system. Customers' appreciate the commitment, crew members in Canada have to personalize service that makes each visit enjoyable as demonstrated by continued year-over-year increases in customer satisfaction scores.Earlier this month, I was in China, we marked a full year since the successful transaction that created the largest McDonald's developmental licensee. The partnership operating at managing McDonald's businesses in Mainland China and Hong Kong offers exceptional business expertise and deep understanding of the local market. They are moving rapidly with ambitious expansion program of at least 2000 new restaurants over five years. They have opened about 375 new restaurants in 2018 over 400 in 2019 and we expect to make a ramp up the phase even more aggressively over the next few years.I was also impressed to see how well the team in China is operating a highly competitive environment. They have made steady gains with our brand image among consumers in China's largest cities as they have modernized nearly 75% of the existing restaurants in the market.China also is a leader in McDonald's system with two of our top growth initiatives, digital and delivery. The market has driven exceptional growth for delivery and is gaining strong adoption for its digital platform.Many of our top international markets are well positioned to drive sustained growth for our business. We have exceptional management teams and aligned franchisees working together to execute ambitious integrated plans.We are confident that we will continue to achieve sustained momentum as our restaurants serve delicious food, offer warm hospitality and advanced strategic platforms enabling us to satisfy rising customer expectations.The U.S. continued to move forward with the most significant transformation ever undertaken in the largest market in the McDonald's system. As we have discussed before, the U.S. team and our franchisees are taking on a lot all at once. U.S. is maintaining an aggressive pace of modernizing restaurants, completing another 1000 projects during the quarter. At our current pace, by the end of 2019 we expect to complete over 12,000 restaurants with our Experience the Future initiative making this the largest construction project in our history. They still have hard work ahead, but we are seeing an encouraging response from customers in restaurants when many of these improvements are already completed.This is in line with our experience in other McDonald's markets such as Canada. The U.K. and Italy that executed program several years ago that was similar to the one the U.S. is undertaking now. This continues to strengthen our confidence, Chris Kempczinski, our U.S. President, his team and our franchisees are on the right track as we introduce these enhancements to a growing number of restaurants.As we've evolved to more heavily franchised business model we're making sure our operating structure continues to adapt. We have a growing number of developmental licensees. These business partners are intensely focused on growth and innovation and operate in some of our most complex markets.",

Please go ahead sir.Craig MercerBefore we begin, I'll remind listeners that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the Company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements.Finally, please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and Britt will reference adjusted earnings, adjusted operating profit margin excluding non-controlling interests, and items excluding foreign currency exchange effects. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors with regard to the Company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing third quarter fiscal 2018 results for further information, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results.Thank you, and here's John Hammergren.John HammergrenThanks, Craig, and thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Today, we reported solid operational performance and we have raised and narrowed fiscal 2018 guidance range of $11.80 to $12.50, to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80, driven by a lower tax rate and lower share count. First the third quarter we generated total company revenues of more than $53 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.41. Before I delve into the details of the quarter let me briefly touch on a couple of recent developments. We are excited to have just closed the acquisition of RxCrossroads. We are committed to broadening and deepening our portfolio of solutions and services to better serve our pharmaceutical and biotechnology or biopharma manufacturer partners’ needs. Our vision is to be the partner of choice across the product life cycle by creating a comprehensive, best-in-class, differentiated set of services. RxCrossroads expands and improves our existing services and third-party logistics, reimbursement access and health and pharmacy solutions. It also compliments our offerings to include upstream plasma logistics and specialized field support.The integration of this business with our existing biopharma facing solutions will enhance our ability to provide turnkey solutions for our manufacturer partners. To assure patients get access to innovative therapies to enable rapid market penetration of products and help manufactures create value. And for payers, we can provide evidence in a value-based way to highlight the best solutions for the patients they server. In summary, we have a unique set of capabilities that bring a superior value proposition to our bio pharma partners.In the third quarter we made the decision to bring the capabilities of our Specialty Health and businesses under Nick Loporcaro’s strong leadership, which will allow us to more closely coordinate and optimize how we provide service and solutions to our manufacturer and provider partners across the health care landscape. Many of you have met Nick at prior Investor Day events. He brings extensive experience to leadership positions he has held at McKesson Canada and McKesson Specialty Health.As some of you may recall when we were beginning to build our specialty franchise more than a decade ago, we made the decision to carve out these assets from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business in order to incubate high growth opportunity to maturity. Now that our specialty franchise is well established and a leader in the market, a decision to combine Specialty Health and U.S. Pharmaceutical under Nick’s leadership is a natural next step in the evolution of these businesses.And for retail pharmacy customers with our recent acquisition of acquisition of Well.ca, we have strengthened our ecommerce capabilities hopping to provide an omni-channel presence in serving our customers in a way that works for them. In addition to leveraging digital capabilities, our suite of retail pharmacy services extends beyond simply filling the prescription. For instance, we connect the patient digitally with the pharmacists for medication education, treatment protocols and medicine scheduling reminders, which drive adherence across our global retail footprint.Turning now to our business results, our North American pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses, which include U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions, had year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 7% on a constant currency basis.I'd like to discuss a few highlights in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Health. The business is now headed by Nick. I'm extremely pleased with the progress of ClarusONE and its strong contribution to our results this year. We have contracted a diverse range of manufacturers delivering benefits to our partner Walmart and more broadly, with all of our customers who purchase generics through us, helping them to be more successful in a competitive and dynamic market.",
                 'MRK': "I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead.Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs.Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings including Item 1A in the 2017 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning.Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com.Finally, in an effort to further improve our communications and transparency, we have posted a presentation to the investor section of Merck.com. This includes some of our highlights from this quarter and we will – throughout this morning's discussion, we will reference certain slides of the presentation.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. The strong performance of our business demonstrates that our innovation strategy is working, and that Merck is on the right track to deliver sustainable value to shareholders and patients. In addition to delivering solid results in the third quarter, we also continued to advance our pipeline with exciting new data readouts and milestones.While there are many aspects of the business to highlight this quarter, I would like to turn first to KEYTRUDA's performance. This drug continues to lead the I-O field with the breadth and depth of indications across multiple tumor types.We've executed well both in the clinic and commercially. And we are seeing firsthand how KEYTRUDA is making a tremendous difference to cancer patients around the world.We are very confident in KEYTRUDA's near- and long-term growth prospects, as we continue to launch existing indications and look towards future approvals. We believe that our approach of following the science throughout KEYTRUDA's development has and will continue to successfully differentiate the medicine as a foundational cancer treatment.We are also encouraged by LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, both targets of our strategic business development, as well as our other oncology assets in the pipeline that position us to further expand our leadership in oncology.Beyond oncology, Merck has the strongest vaccine portfolio in our company's history, led by GARDASIL, which continues to experience healthy demand and growth. The Hospital and Specialty business is performing well. And our Animal Health business is an industry leader.We have great momentum as we close out the year and prepare for 2019, given our existing portfolio and pipeline. And we are confident about our long-term outlook.As a reflection of our confidence in our future growth prospects, today we announced a dividend increase, along with an accelerated share repurchase program, which Rob will talk about in more detail in a moment.These actions are driven by our commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy and supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation that provide us the flexibility to return cash to shareholders, while also investing in our pipeline, innovation, and growth. Even with these actions, we continue to have ample capacity for business development, which remains a major priority.Looking ahead, we are confident in the strength of our business. We believe that our well-balanced portfolio will continue to drive sustainable growth and value creation.",
                 'MET': "Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time-to-time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations' portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements.A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides, including substantial disclosure in the appendix on our long-term care book of business. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to the main body of the supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations.After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend no longer than the top of the hour. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, in fairness to all participants.With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife has been engaged in one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. For a number of years, much of our business was characterized by capital-intensive long-tailed liabilities with low levels of free cash flow. Our strategy has been to transform MetLife into a company with a different profile, less capital-intensive, with shorter payback periods, and higher cash flow.While some of the business we wrote in years past will take time to run off our books, we believe we are now at an inflection point where the heavy lifting of our transformation is just about complete.We are executing more consistently and the results in the quarter and for the year-to-date 2018 demonstrate that our strategy is working. We delivered third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.38 per share, up from $1.04 per share a year ago. Once again, our business fundamentals were strong: solid underwriting; good investment results; and disciplined expense management across the company. Reflecting our strong results, adjusted return on equity in the quarter rose to 12.9% from 9.1% a year ago.After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.53 per share. Notable items in the third quarter included a net charge of $0.07 per share associated with our annual actuarial review and other insurance adjustments, as well as $0.09 per share of costs to support our expense initiative.MetLife's annual actuarial review, which we completed during the third quarter, examined the actuarial assumptions underpinning our insurance liabilities around the world. Going into the quarter, there was considerable market interest in long-term care. Our LTC review of all assumptions, models and the margin testing process, which incorporated a third-party actuarial review, concluded that no long-term care reserve unlocking was necessary.Following the review, our long-term care loss recognition testing margin now stands at $2.1 billion. Along with other insurance adjustments, the impact of the actuarial review on adjusted earnings was negative $68 million. The incremental effect of the actuarial review on net income was negative $230 million. None of these amounts were associated with long-term care insurance.",
                 'MTD': " I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.Mary FinneganThanks, Holly, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I am the Treasurer, and I'm responsible for Investor Relations, and glad that you're joining us today. I'm joined here today by -- with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; Bill Donnelly, our Executive Vice President and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. I want to cover just a couple of financial administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation we refer to is also on our website.Let me summarize the Safe Harbor language, which is outlined on Page 2 of the presentation. Statements in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see the discussion in our recent Form 10-K. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the captions, factors affecting our future operating results, and in the business and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Form 10-K.Just one other item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information with respect to the use of, and the differences between, non-GAAP financial measures and most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our Form 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Olivier.Olivier FilliolThank you, Mary, and welcome to everyone on the call. I will start with a summary of the quarter, Bill will provide details on our third quarter results, and Shawn will be discuss our guidance for the rest of this year and for 2019. I will then have some additional comments, and we will open the lines for Q&A. The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. We are pleased with our sales growth, which was 7% in local currency in the quarter. Our laboratory products had very good broad-based growth. In addition, China had strong growth despite excellent sales growth in the prior year. Our sales growth, combined with results from our margin and productivity measures, drove a 17% increase in adjusted EPS.Let me comment briefly on how we observe current market conditions and how we are deploying our strategies given the environment. First, demand in our markets remains good. Sales, orders, even leads look solid. But there are many reasons to be cautious about the global economy, including higher interest rates, a strong dollar and uncertainty and costs arising from tariff disputes. I would characterize it as a sunny weather but clouds on the horizon. These clouds provide a different outlook than it was 1 year ago when we gave guidance for 2018.So what do these clouds mean for us in terms of strategy deployment? We clearly remain focused on growth. We are investing for growth but somewhat more cautiously than we were at this time last year. We want to remain agile and react to, even to a certain extent and anticipate a slowdown. We are confident that we can continue to deliver share gains, irrelevant of underlying market growth. And with our strong focus on margin enhancement and cost management, this should translate to reasonable earnings growth under almost any circumstance. Shawn will cover this further in his comments on guidance.I now want to turn it over to Bill, but before I do, I want to acknowledge that this is Bill's last earnings call with us. Bill has made tremendous contribution to Mettler-Toledo over more than 20 years. I have worked closely with Bill and want to personally thank him for his support, dedication and leadership with the organization. Bill's personality, in particular his sense of humor and his down-to-earth approach to our challenges, will be missed.I think one of Bill's greatest contribution to Mettler-Toledo was his nurturing and development of his successors. He leaves the global supply chain and IT organizations in good hands with Oliver Wittorf, who many of you will hear from on Monday at our investor meeting. And, as I think many of you have seen over the last year or so, he leaves the finance organization in the skilled hands of Shawn, who has worked with Bill for many of this -- of his 20 years here. Bill, an official thank you for all of your contribution to Mettler-Toledo and you know I personally wish you all the best for the future.",
                 'MGM': "Participants are in listen-only mode. After the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note this conference is being recorded.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts InternationalWell, thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce that our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations with solid overall performance, despite of course the year-over-year challenging comparisons that we faced here in Las Vegas. Company continues to generate strong cash flows and we're focused on appropriately allocating the capital as it aligns with our overall strategic objective. In the third quarter, we distributed $64 million in quarterly dividends and we've repurchased $176 million of stock, demonstrating our commitment to returning capital to the shareholder.We remain focused on bringing our consolidated net leverage down to between three to four times by 2020 as we grow our cash flows including the benefit of all of our new properties and as well as we manage all of our debt level. We're all well aware that the third quarter was challenging in Las Vegas given the strong comparisons in the prior year, which of course benefited from two fights, strong table games volume, high hold and a favorable convention calendar mix.In the third quarter this year, there were 120,000 fewer large-scale convention attendees citywide. This resulted in of course heavy reliance on leisure channels and the summer months ended up acting more like the traditional summer months that we've seen historically. While our Las Vegas Strip RevPAR was down year-over-year, it was ahead of our guidance and we still achieved our second best third quarter RevPAR on record. By the way, our convention mix in the third quarter was also our third best.Our regional properties continued the strong growth we've seen over the last three years. We delivered a 5% increase in EBITDA to $207 million. And in fact our Mississippi properties, MGM Detroit and MGM National Harbor, all had record third quarter. Our regional strategy to operate the premier assets in key markets continues to prove successful and we're maximizing the value of these assets.We're also continuing to strengthen our position internationally. Over in Macau, we experienced revenue growth of 37% to over $600 million. Adjusted property EBITDA increased over 7% to $130 million. MGM Cotai started out slowly, continues to ramp in the third quarter and the property though experienced a pretty low hold, which impacted its adjusted EBITDA by about $16 million in the quarter.On August 24, we successfully opened MGM Springfield and the property is already off to a good start. We've received great feedback from our guests who have enjoyed the unique environment and our fellow community members who have welcomed the fresh wave of energy and the local opportunity to the town of Springfield and Western Mass. more broadly. While it's still in its early days, we're encouraged that the resort is performing in line with our expectations on both the gaming and non-gaming side.Here at home in Las Vegas, we're reaching the final stages of the Park MGM transformation. Earlier this month, in fact on October 12, we officially opened the NoMad on the top four floors of the building. MGM and the Sydell Group headed by Andrew Zobler has truly created something special here and it is a unique destination in Las Vegas. Looking ahead in the coming weeks, we'll open up a couple new restaurants and a nightlife concept. We open Eataly at the end of the year and our front entrance, all of which will be done in December.",
                 'MCHP': "J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.Net sales in the December quarter were $994.2 million, modestly higher than the midpoint of our guidance and down 1.8% sequentially from net sales of $1.012 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range of 61.4% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at 22% of sales which was a record low and below the low end of our guidance range which was 22.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $391.7 million at 39.4% above the high end of our guidance of 39.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $341.2 million and was up 38.4% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.36 which was above the midpoint of our guidance.On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were a record 61.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $361.8 million, and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $121 million, share-based compensation of $20.5 million, $1.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million.GAAP net income was impacted by a $439.8 million discrete tax event in the quarter primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we also incurred a loss of $2.1 million on the retirement of our 2037 2.125% convertible bonds. After these adjustments, the GAAP net loss was $251.1 million or $1.07 per diluted share.The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.5% in the December quarter, and we expect the rate to be about the same in the March quarter. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we expect about $300 million of taxes to be paid over the next eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore referred to as the transition tax. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $25 million in years one through five, $45 million in year six, $60 million in year seven and $75 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and these estimates may change as we complete our analysis.We are working through the impact of recent U.S. tax reform on Microchip's longer term effective tax rate. There is no impact on the fiscal year 2018 rate as you can see from our March quarter guidance provided in today's earnings release. Excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be below 9%, which is what we are providing to investors and analysts for cash flow and operating model forecasting purposes. We will continue to refine this over the coming months prior to providing guidance for Q1 of fiscal year 2019.Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at December 31, 2017, was $487.1 million. Microchip had 115 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 34 days and up 3 days from the prior quarter, and in the normal historical range for distribution inventory.The cash flow from operating activities was a record $365 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash could be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost.We bought back the remaining amount of our 2037, 2.125% convertible bonds in the December quarter through $58.3 million in cash. Capital expenditures were $66.4 million in the December 2017 quarter. We expect about $50 million to $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $210 million, which is at the lower end of the guidance that we provided last quarter.",
                 'MAA': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.Tim Argo Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I will now turn the call over to Eric.Eric Bolton Thanks, Tim. Good morning. The demand for apartment housing across our footprint remained strong and shows no signs of moderating. High demand and low resident turnover have supported our ability to capture strong occupancy and positive rent growth despite the high levels of new supply in several of our markets. On a blended lease-over-lease basis as compared to the prior in place leases, rents grew by 3.1% in the third quarter. This is 60 basis points better than the same time last year.While we've not yet wrapped up our budgeting efforts for next year, we do expect that strong demand will offer the opportunity for continued positive momentum in rent growth during 2019, despite the new supply headwinds. As part of our fall budgeting process, we performed a robust and detailed assessment of the new supply outlook across our portfolio. Supplementing the information from third-party research, we do a property-by-property and immediate submarket review to consider specifically how new supply is likely to pressure leasing across our portfolio in the coming year.Tom will share more in his comments, but our early assessment is that the 2019 new supply pressures at a portfolio level will likely moderate slightly from the volume of new deliveries in 2018 and support continued improved -- improvement in new lease rent growth in 2019. We continue to capture good results from the various expense synergies and new initiatives coming out of our merger with Post Properties, primarily in the area of repair and maintenance costs. As we approach the two year mark since our merger, we do expect that we'll begin to see some of the initial lift from expense synergies start to moderate on a year-over-year basis, as we move into 2019.During the quarter, we did see some pressure from real estate taxes and hurricane cleanup. Al will speak to this in his comments, but with cap rates compressing further over the past year, as our annual tax build started coming in over the last couple of months. The corresponding impact on real estate taxes has been evident. As noted in our updated guidance for the year, we pulled down our expectation for property acquisitions and do not expect to close on anything between now and year-end. Significant pools of profit capital continue to aggressively bid our pricing. As it has been for years, our capital deployment protocols are built around the goal to be earnings accretive in fairly short order. Today's pricing for stabilized properties or even though still in initially lease-up are rarely meeting our earnings accretion goal at this point.On the development front, we're continuing to find opportunities that we believe will offer attractive and accretive NOI yields. As noted in our earnings release, during the third quarter, we started construction on a Phase II expansion in our Sync36 property in Denver bringing our current development pipeline to $148 million. We currently have additional sites either owned or under contract in Denver, Houston, Fort Worth and Orlando they are currently in pre-development. We hope to get started with these projects at some point during the coming year.In addition to this development pipeline, we have another five properties representing over 1,600 units currently under initial leased up in all performing in line with our expectations. In addition to our new development and lease-up pipelines, we continue to capture strong returns on our redevelopment pipeline with over 6,500 units redeveloped so far this year generating very attractive returns on capital. We have another roughly 20,000 units that we expect to redevelop over the coming two to three years.",

You can refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investor Information section of our website for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Lorberbaum, Mohawk's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Jeff?Jeffrey LorberbaumThank you, Frank. In the third quarter, we generated sales of $2.5 billion, up 4% compared to the prior year. For the period, our adjusted operating income was $314 million or 12.3% of sales with an adjusted EPS of $3.29. In the quarter, start-up costs related to new capital projects were $20 million, in line with our plan. Our third quarter results fell short of our expectations. Sales growth in all segments was lower than our estimates. Price increases had less impact, and we experienced more inflation than predicted. Transportation costs continued to rise due to limited availability of common carriers and higher fuel prices. Additional manufacturing reductions were required during the period to control inventory. Our LVT sales were up significantly, but were constrained by internal production. Our margins were further impacted by a decline in product mix from customers trading down, import competition due to the strengthening dollar and higher volumes in channels which use lower-value products.In the U.S., we continued to execute additional pricing across most product categories to offset ongoing pricing inflationary pressures. Our LVT sales are expanding from both greater internal production and sourcing programs. We announced price increases on products that we import from China to pass through the new tariffs and other inflation. We are increasing our internal trucking to enhance service to our customers and control costs. Approximately 40% of our sales are outside the United States, and most of the major markets have experienced weakening. Sales growth in most of our European products slowed from the prior period, along with the economy, and margins were impacted by cost inflation and a weakening product mix.Though political uncertainty has led to a decline in the Mexican ceramic market, we are increasing our sales with product innovation and expanded distribution. In the period, the acquisition of Godfrey Hirst added revenues of approximately $70 million, even as the Australian market slowed due to lending restrictions and reduced exports to China.In our non-U.S. businesses, we are increasing prices as conditions permit, introducing innovative products, expanding our distribution and reducing our costs. We have many investments in new products and geographies that are in various stages of completion from presently being constructed to ramping up with limited utilization and lower product mix. Over time, these projects will progress from starting up with losses to a breakeven position and finally, to achieving our planned margins when sales productivity and product mix are optimized. The combined sales of these potential investments will exceed $1.2 billion and when optimized, should contribute margins similar to our existing businesses. Some benefits of these projects will be realized next year, but most will occur in 2020 and beyond when operating at anticipated levels.The projects already starting up are rigid LVT and premium laminate in the United States, ceramic in Mexico and rigid LVT, carpet tile, porcelain slabs, technical tile and premium laminate in Europe. Other projects under construction include quartz countertops in the U.S., porcelain tile in Poland and sheet vinyl premium laminate in Russia. Even as we addressed the current environment, we are positive about the long-term value of these investments and our sales and profitability. We are confident about Mohawk's position in the global market and our aggressive strategy to deliver long-term profits and returns. Our Board of Directors has approved a new plan to purchase $500 million of our company's stock.With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to review the segments. Chris?William WellbornThank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales decreased about 1% as reported to $886 million, with challenges from inflation, pricing pressures and lower growth in most of our markets. Adjusted operating income for the segment was approximately $119 million or 13.4% of sales. During the period, our U.S. volume expanded, while margins were pressured by price, mix and higher transportation costs. Increased competition from imports due to a strong dollar and the growth of LVT continued to impact the U.S. ceramic industry. We have announced a price increase to recover freight and are taking other actions to improve our mix and margins. We're expanding our larger-size tiles, increasing our technical porcelain collections and growing our porcelain slab offering. Our patented technology to enhance the durability in slips and falls is being well accepted in both residential and commercial channels.We're introducing commercial LVT into Dal-Tile's offering, and we are testing a number of new innovations which could be significant, including a patented technology to reduce the time and cost of ceramic installation and a patented porcelain roof tile system.",
                 'TAP': "Good day, and welcome to the Molson Coors Brewing Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars.Our call will open with some remarks from Mark Swartzberg, Vice President of Investor Relations at Molson Coors. Please go ahead.Mark Swartzberg - Molson Coors Brewing Co.Yeah, thank you, Chad, and hello, everyone. I am delighted to be here at Molson Coors after being on the other side of this call for many years. Following the prepared remarks this morning, management will take your questions. In order to allow as many people to ask questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. That's one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please return to the queue.Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Hunter.Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.Thank you, Mark, and hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Tracey Joubert, our CFO; the CEOs of each of our four business units: Lee Reichert, our Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller.Today, Tracey and I will be take you through our plans to drive long-term and total shareholder returns, highlighting our third quarter results and also discuss our outlook for the business. As usual, we're offering related slides on the Investor Relations page of our website. Before doing that, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of Bill Coors earlier this month. Our company stands on the shoulders of giants like Bill, who was a Chairman of Coors for over 40 years, and we honor his memory by rededicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much, brewing highest-quality beer to share with family and friends, one of life's simple pleasures.Now this quarter reflects progress on a number of fronts, as we drive our consistent First Choice strategy of earning more, using less and investing wisely. Brand volume grew in developed and developing markets outside of North America. NSR per hectoliter grew globally. We announced incremental cost reductions in the U.S. to protect investment and counter inflation. We grew underlying EBITDA in constant currency in each of our four business units. We further paid down debt as our teams across the business reduced working capital and cash taxes. And in early October, we completed the formation of Truss, our Canadian cannabis joint venture, naming Brett Vye as CEO. Brett is a long-standing commercial leader and most recently served as the Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer for our fast growing International division.In relation to debt pay down, we've generated $2.5 billion of underlying free cash flow since the end of 2016. We're committed to $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, in free cash flow for this year. Additionally, we remain committed to our plan for rating agency leverage of 3.75 times by mid-2019, our current dividend payment, and the dividend intentions we communicated in June of this year.Let me now turn to underlying business trends and our outlook. The volume growth we are seeing outside North America is driven by consistency of our First Choice strategy, the breadth and depth of our global brand portfolio, and a positive industry. Europe, our second largest business unit by volume, is growing consistently and accelerating the pace of portfolio premiumization, while our International business unit led by the Latin American markets posted mid-teens growth due to the strong performance of our global brands, led by Coors Light and the Miller Trademark brands of MGD, Miller Lite and Miller High Life.Turning to North America, in the U.S. brand volumes or STRs were below industry volumes. As we've indicated, improving our volume performance in the U.S. is a priority, and the first step is to improve our share performance through Coors Light and accelerated premiumization of the portfolio. In the quarter, Coors Light STRs declined a moderating rate sequentially. Miller Lite continued to take share in premium lights and also declined a moderating rate. Above premium trends improved sequentially, benefiting from Peroni and Sol, our regional craft brands, Arnold Palmer Spiked and Henry's Hard Sparkling.In Canada, brand volume trends improved sequentially and the Miller Trademark and Belgian Moon brand grew strongly in the quarter. We continue to make progress in relation to stabilizing and improving the volume and profitability of our Canadian business and returning this business to growth.Turning to outlook, we remain committed to our performance guidance for 2018, and I'll comment in more detail on each of our business units after passing the call to Tracey. Before I do that, let me offer a few comments about how our organization is focused on earning more, using less, and investing wisely by utilizing our Profit after Capital Charge, or PACC model. We believe we have the right strategy to grow shareholder value over the medium to long-term. That strategy has delivered consistent business performance improvements over the past three years. And as I mentioned, we remain committed to our 2018 guidance despite a more challenging inflationary environment.In terms of top line performance, characterized as earning more, we continue to drive our First Choice approach, strengthening and premiumizing our brand portfolio, building powerful customer relationships and driving disruptive growth. To this last point, our new Truss cannabis joint venture is just one example of this. The combination of Molson Coors Canada and HEXO, the cannabis market leader in Québec, offers a tremendous opportunity to shape the nonalcoholic cannabis-infused beverages category upon its planned legalization in Canada in the fall of 2019. And we believe we will secure a meaningful share of this potentially high-value category and prepare ourselves for potential further International expansion.",
                 'MDLZ': "I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.Shep DunlapThank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and the risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.Dirk Van de PutThank you, Shep, and good afternoon. We delivered very solid results for the third quarter. We continue to build momentum on the top line while increasing both adjusted growth and operating margin, and we delivered another double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share. Our third quarter organic net revenue grew 1.2%, which includes 60 basis points of headwind for onetime malware effects last year, and it was supported by positive volume growth. We also delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18% at constant currency and solid free cash flow, which is now $1.1 billion year-to-date. As I laid out at our Investor Day last month, we are excited about the growth potential of snacking. Vibrant categories like chocolate and biscuits are growing faster than other areas in food. I want to thank many of you for attending and giving us an opportunity to share our vision and priorities around growth, execution and culture. Mondelez is well positioned to lead the future of snacking, thanks to our unique portfolio of iconic global and local brands and our advantaged geographic footprint.Nearly 40% of our revenues come from fast-growing emerging markets, which we expect will disproportionately contribute to future snacking growth. In the third quarter, emerging markets continue to show strong momentum and delivered an increase in revenues of 6%. This was driven by positive volume and pricing with particular strength in Russia, India, Mexico, China, South East Asia and Africa. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 4.5%.In North America, as we discussed with you before, we are working to address several issues in our business which, as expected, continue to impact results. On the biscuits consumer side, overall consumption and our share were positive with key brands such as Oreo, Ritz and belVita performing well, but we have more work to do to improve our service delivery.Over the past couple of years, we've already made significant changes in North America, and we are now producing around 60% of our volume on advantaged assets in the region. We are continuing with additional end-to-end investments in capacity, systems and people, and we are seeing the progress. However, it will take us time to fix and, as such, progress will not be linear.Turning to our long-term growth strategy. I would like to share with you the progress we are making towards our strategic growth priorities. But before I do, let me remind you what they are. First, we are accelerating consumer-centric growth. Second, we are driving operational excellence in everything we do. And third, we are building a winning growth culture. Our long-term goal is to deliver volume-led top line growth that translates into high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and attractive free cash flow generation. Unlocking further growth requires us to put the consumer at the heart of our work. We will do so by further contemporizing our brands, capitalizing on untapped growth opportunities in channels and geographies and overhauling our marketing and innovation agenda. Let's look at innovation in a bit more detail.As I explained at our Investor Day, we're implementing a more agile innovation model founded on the test, learn and scale principle and grounded in local consumer insights. A good example of this is the recent introduction in Europe of Joy Fills, an innovative product platform that we're launching under the Oreo, Cadbury and Milka brands at the same time. Our European team has taken this idea to market in record time, creating an entirely new product format for consumers to munch on. Imagine it as a crispy, pea-sized biscuit with a creamy filling that offers a light, but indulgent, treat. Early indications are positive, and we're looking forward to seeing more.Over in India, our recently launched Lickables product continues to do well with consumers, helping deliver 90 basis points of chocolate share gains year-to-date in a market where we already have strong leadership. And here in the U.S., Oreo, which is already posting a mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, is getting ready for the launch of the biggest Oreo cookie yet, the Most Stuf edition.",
                 'MNST': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp.Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our last Vice Chairman and President, is with me today; as is Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Finance.Before we begin, I'd like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and which are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends.Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2018, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2018, including the sections contained therein entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements for discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures which may be mentioned during the course of this call is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated November 7, 2018. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section.There are encouraging signs in the beverage category globally, and we continue to see positive momentum in the energy category. Net sales for the 2018 third quarter were negatively impacted by $11.6 million, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606. Under ASC 606, commissions paid to The Coca-Cola Company based on our sales to certain of the company's customers, which The Coca-Cola Company accounts for under the equity method or consolidates, are now included as a reduction to net sales. Whereas, prior to January 1, 2018, commissions based on sales to those customers, which Coca-Cola accounts for under the equity method, were included in operating expenses.Gross and net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective November 1, 2018, on certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The company estimates that impact to gross and net sales was approximately $18 million and $16 million, respectively.In the third quarter of 2018, net sales were $1.02 billion, up 11.7%, from $909.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Without the adoption ASC 606, the percentage increase in net sales would have been 13%. Net sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.3 million of foreign currency movements.The company recorded third quarter gross sales of $1.18 billion, up 13.7%, from $1.04 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Gross sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $5.6 million of foreign currency movements.Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2018 third quarter was 59.8%, compared with 62.6% in the 2017 third quarter. The gross profit percentage, as adjusted for ASC 606, would have been 60.3% for the quarter.The decrease in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to increases in certain import costs such as aluminum cans, freight in and other input costs; the $11.6 million of commissions accounted for as a reduction to net sales due to the adoption of ASC 606; an increase in promotional allowances as a percentage of gross sales; domestic product sales mix; and geographical gross profit mix.Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 4.1% for the 2018 third quarter as compared to 3.2% in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of $12.8 million, largely due to higher carrier contract rates in the U.S.Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.2% compared to 12.7% in the same quarter a year ago. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of net sales, were 11.1% as compared to 11.8% in the same quarter last year. Included in general and administrative costs were distributor termination expenses of $14.1 million for the 2018 third quarter, as compared with the $15.9 million in the comparable 2017 third quarter.",
                 'MCO': "Stephen MaireThank you.

I am Steve Maire, Global Head of Investor Relations and Communications. This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2018, as well as our current outlook for full year 2018.

These, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel.Raymond McDanielThank you, Steve. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Before we begin, I am pleased to welcome Mark Kaye to his first earnings call. Mark joined Moody's on August 20 as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter and year-to-date 2018 financial results. Mark Kaye will then follow with additional third quarter financial details and operating highlights. I will conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2018. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.In the third quarter, Moody's revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% from the third quarter of 2017. This result reflected strong growth from Moody's Analytics, partially offset by a decline of Moody's Investors Service as non-financial corporate debt issuance slowed versus the record level in the prior year period. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 totaled $614 million, approximately flat to the prior year period. Operating income was $467 million, up 4% from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income of $514 million was up 3%. Foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact on operating income and adjusted operating income.The operating margin was 43.2% and the adjusted operating margin was 47.6%. Moody's diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.59 per share, down 2% from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.69, up 11%, and excluded $0.10 per share related to amortization of acquired intangible assets.Third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS excluded a $0.23 per share foreign currency hedge gain and $0.12 per share related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses associated with the Bureau van Dijk acquisition.Turning to the year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first nine months of 2018 was a record $3.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3%; and non-U.S. revenue was $1.6 billion, up 23%.Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Moody's Investors Service revenue of $2.1 billion was up 3% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $1.3 billion, up 1%; and non-U.S. revenue was $848 million, up 8%.Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%. Moody's Analytics revenue was $1.3 billion, a 28% increase from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $513 million was up 9% and non-U.S. revenue of $752 million was up 45%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. Organic MA revenue for the first nine months of 2018, which included Bureau van Dijk revenue as of August 11, was $1.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year period.Moody's Corporation operating expenses for the first nine months of 2018 were $1.9 billion, up 12% from the prior year period. This growth was primarily driven by the inclusion of Bureau van Dijk operating expenses as well as incremental compensation related to salary adjustments and hiring, partially offset by lower accruals for 2018 incentive compensation awards.",
                 'MS': "ntationSharon YeshayaI will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.James GormanThank you, Sharon. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. Over the last several years we have focused on a number of things. Firstly, taking actions necessary to fix the obvious and immediate problems that we faced, secondly putting a strategy in place, the right strategy which was focused on a balanced business with more effective risk controls, and thirdly, meaningfully investing in our culture to ensure we remain an important choice for top talent and manage our business with professionalism with whatever challenges we face.These strategic choices were designed to ensure that as much as we can control, the firm does well in a strong market environment and demonstrates stability in a seasonally or structurally more difficult one and that is exactly how 2018 is shaping up. The first half of the year was characterized by strong market environment and increased levels of client activity. Commensurate with that backdrop we delivered returns above the top end of the ROE target range of 10% to 13% of that first half period.The third quarter of course was impacted by the traditional summer slowdown and a more fragile trading environment. Even so, we delivered an ROE of 11.5% and an ROTCE of 13.2%. These are comfortably within our target ranges and firm revenues of $9.9 billion. In prior periods through 2008 when we delivered revenues of $9 billion to $10 billion we had a leverage ratio of 30 to 40 times. Obviously, we have dramatically changed the way we conduct our business.What was most pleasing in Q3 was the stability across the whole franchise. Though we can clearly have aberrations in any one quarter, we believe that we have set a floor while at the same time created significant upside potentials. Investing in our talent and building out our leadership team is an essential ingredient to what we see as an exciting path forward. Our ability to attract talent from across the street, relatively low attrition levels, and high employee satisfaction are all hard evidence of the strong culture. Our challenge is to make sure this endures not the weeks, months or even years, but for decades to come.With Q3 now behind us we look forward to spending more time discussing growth opportunities in the months and years ahead. In the meantime we remain confident and optimistic about the near-term prospects with a strong finish through 2018.I'll now turn it over to Jon who will discuss the quarter in detail.Jonathan PruzanThank you and good morning. The results in the third quarter demonstrated strengths despite the typical summer slowdown. Our performance illustrates the resiliency of our business model and the ability to perform across an array of market environments. We reported revenues of $9.9 billion and PBT of $2.9 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.17, ROE was 11.5% and ROTCE was 13.2%.Institutional securities performed well. Investment banking benefited from continued strategic activity and new capital formation globally. Compared to historical third quarters equity's results were strong. Fixed income showed stability despite seasonally slower client flows and a lack of larger transactions. Wealth management delivered another solid quarter and investment management saw continued positive long term net flows although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.We continue to benefit from the inherent operating leverage of our business model. On a year-to-date basis, our efficiency ratio was 70% and almost 200 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. Increased expenses have primarily been driven by higher compensation and execution related costs associated with the higher revenues.Our discipline around discretionary spending has allowed us to continue to make investments across the firm especially in technology. Although we typically see a seasonal increase in expenses in the fourth quarter, we remain confident we will hit our full year efficiency ratio target.Now to the businesses, institutional securities generated revenues of $4.9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share. Non-compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, an 8% sequential increase, driven primarily by lower execution related expenses and compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing the year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio revenue to 34.5%.Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion down 14% relative to the second quarter reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity. Notably this is our best third quarter in over a decade contributing to our record year-to-date revenues. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $510 million. M&A volumes remained at historically high levels supported by larger strategic transactions and cross border activity. Pipelines remained healthy and dialogues are active.",
                 'MOS': "Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.comWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our first quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Mosaic's momentum continue to build in the third quarter. Our results reflect improved market conditions as well as the benefits of the many moves we've made to strengthen the company. Our key points today are, first, Mosaic has made tremendous progress. We've transformed our businesses and created significant operational leverage. Second, global potash and phosphate market fundamentals are improving. Demand growth remained strong while supply is materializing slowly. And, third, as a result of our increased operational leverage and improving market conditions, we are optimistic about our future, both near and longer term. We have a road map to generate significant cash and drive strong shareholder returns.For the quarter, Mosaic's net earnings were $247 million compared with $227 million a year ago. Year-to-date, net earnings were $358 million. We delivered earnings per share of $0.64 or $0.75 net of notable items, a year-over-year increase of 78% despite our higher share count. Just one year ago, we announced significant financial and operational moves to position the company for success. We idled our Plant City phosphate operations and indicated we would focus on increasing the efficiency and recovery rate at our remaining phosphate plants.We announced significant increases in our expected transformational targets related to Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced our intention to delever the balance sheet by 2020. Since we announced these actions, we have accelerated our progress and created significant earnings leverage as today's results clearly indicate. We reported year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion. We increased our 2018 synergy expectation from Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced we've reached our through-cycle debt-to-EBITDA targets.Overall, good market conditions and robust performance across our three business units are leading to better 2018 results than our initial expectations. Today, we increased our guidance for 2018 annual adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.80 to $2 per share.Let's start with Mosaic Fertilizantes, our business in South America. Year-to-date, in 2018, Mosaic Fertilizantes has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $277 million compared with the pro forma EBITDA of $50 million a year ago. The performance of that business has been helped by excellent Brazilian agricultural market conditions and a weaker Brazilian real. But the key driver of the improved earnings has been our transformation of the business. We are achieving synergies faster than expected and we now expect to reach $140 million to $160 million in net savings in 2018. We also expect to reach our target of $275 million in net savings well before the end of 2020.The transformation of the business and the benefits of our upstream/downstream integration are easily visible, both on the ground in Brazil and in our results. Across our plants and mines, employees are energized and they are bringing innovative ideas to improve our operating efficiency. When we announced the transaction, we expected it to be accretive to earnings. Year-to-date, the acquired business has added $0.11 per share, inclusive of the impact of issuing $1 billion in debt and 34 million shares, but exclusive of the $8 million reserve in the third quarter for the potential of paying out on the contingent portion of the purchase price.",

Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.Thanks, Chris, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 13%, grew EPS 27%, and generated more cash compared to last year on continued strength in both segments.Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year, and now sits at a Q3 record ending $9.5 billion, and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog, related to the Airwave and ESN extensions, or the State of Florida award.And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts.Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.Thank you, Greg. Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions, and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency. GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year, due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million, or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year, due to acquisitions.GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was up $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings, as well as a lower tax rate. Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million, or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million, or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million, or 5%.Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10%, primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million, or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects.We expect full-year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million, or 9% versus last year, with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million, or 4%.Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million, or 22% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million, or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix.",
                 'MSCI': "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Wiechmann, Head of Investor Relations, Strategy and Corporate Development. You may begin.Andrew Wiechmann - MSCI, Inc.Thank you, Imani. Good day and welcome to the MSCI third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the third quarter 2018. A copy of the release and the slide presentation that we've prepared for this call may be viewed at msci.com under the Investor Relations tab.Let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and are governed by the language on the second slide of today's presentation. For a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.During today's call in addition to GAAP results, we also refer to non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. We believe our non-GAAP measures facilitate meaningful period-to-period comparisons and provide a baseline for the evaluation of results. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP measures in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures on pages 22 to 26 of the earnings presentation.We will also discuss organic run rate growth figures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency and the impact of any acquisitions or divestitures.On the call today are Henry Fernandez, our Chairman and CEO; Baer Pettit, our President; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. With that, let me turn the call over to Henry Fernandez.Henry A. Fernandez - MSCI, Inc.Thanks, Andy, and good day everyone. The exceptional results from the third quarter, including the 11% growth in organic subscription run rate, reflect the power of MSCI franchise and highlight the growing importance of that franchise in an investment industry undergoing a significant transformation.We continue to benefit from favorable secular trends, particularly with the continued growth in global investing, utilizing passive strategies, adopting ESG and the factor criteria, and using risk management frameworks.On top of these secular trends, we have a very diversified business at MSCI, basically an all-weather franchise with natural hedges and in a wide range of market regimes.We benefit one way or another in any market where there is active or passive; risk on or risk off; high volatility or low volatility; developed or emerging market; U.S., Europe, or Asia; sustainable investing or not; asset owners, asset managers, or trading firms; strong dollar or weak dollar; high valuations when we sell businesses, like we've done in the last few months, or low when we buy them, hopefully someday in the future; high MSCI price, when we feel good, or low MSCI price, when we buy lots of shares. We basically have a franchise that capitalizes in most market environment.Let me now give you a few example from the clients' perspectives. In these volatile conditions, our clients are increasingly using our risk management tools to better understand their exposures, run scenario analysis, and position their portfolios for various market shocks. To gain insight into the drivers of performance and risk and to build portfolios in this volatile market environment, our clients are showing elevated interest in our factor analytics and factor indices.For investors that expect sustained economic growth with moderate inflation and gradually rising interest rates, our factor analytics and factor indices help them build portfolios around strategies that have performed well in these scenarios, such as growth, momentum, and progressing in all (5:09) sectors.Alternatively, investors that believe that trade wars, increasing inflation, and rising interest rates will hinder economic growth use our factor tools and factor indices to help them take advantage of strategies like minimum volatility, quality, value, high dividend yield, or defensive sectors.Given the weakness in emerging markets, our clients are showing a strong interest in all our emerging market content from indices to risk models to ESG. Our emerging market and single country risk factor models, including our recently released China Equity Model 6, help clients better understand the drivers of performance and risk in those markets.Recently, we are seeing a growing level of attention on companies that lack transparency, engage in socially unacceptable behavior, damage the environment, or are governed in ways not aligned with shareholder or constituent interest. This trend continues to drive and fuel the growth of all our ESG products and services.In summary, MSCI's strength is that we have tools to help the investment community in any market environment.",
                 'MYL': 'As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now it’s my pleasure to turn the call to Melissa Trombetta, Head of Global Investor Relations. You may begin.Melissa TrombettaThank you, Carmen. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Mylan’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me for today’s call are Mylan’s Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.During today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today’s projections.Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC’s Regulation Fair Disclosure.In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our third quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides, as well as on our website.Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call, except for the participants’ questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan’s express written permission. An archived copy of today’s call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Heather.Heather BreschThank you, Melissa. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today’s call. While we are continuing to see the global healthcare environment evolve at a rapid space, Mylan’s third quarter performance was in line with our expectations and we delivered solid year-over-year growth. However, in the market search for stability, analyzing certain indicators and isolation can exacerbate volatility.We will discuss our perspective related to several examples of these during today’s call whether that be Mylan’s pending generic Advair approval, utilization of biosimilars and complex generics or the overemphasis of the impact of commoditized oral solid dose products within our North America business.Our ability to deliver long-term growth is not dependent upon the timing of any one approval, any one country’s market dynamics or any one dosage form, but rather the broader, more complete context of Mylan’s global diversified business model.More than 7,500 products around the world divided almost equally between generic and brand sales, market leadership in countries around our geographies and a scientific platform that has generated a record number of complex generics and biosimilar launches for Mylan year-to-date. We continue to believe Mylan is built to last.With all this said, we remain committed to our full year 2018 guidance provided in August and this confirmation is not dependent on any single product approval or launch.In North America, while our business is predominantly generic, we are benefiting from a broader mix of dosage forms well beyond oral solids and are seeing continued stabilization of the pricing environment. Year-to-date, we have launched nearly 40 new products in North America with two-thirds of these being injectables.In Europe, our business benefits from an equal mix of branded generic and over-the-counter products. Year-to-date, we have launched nearly 300 products across all of these channels. Our commercial infrastructure in Europe allows us to maximize key launches such as our insulin analog and the first wave of our biosimilar to Humira across countries in this region.In our Rest of World segment, Mylan’s smallest but fastest growing region, we have seen consistent double-digit growth for the year, with more than 130 new product launches year-to-date. We also continue to benefit from organic and inorganic new product opportunities in this region, including Sebivo and TOBI.These results are made possible, thanks to the successful integration of our differentiated global platform, which allows this management team to be 100% focused on executing and maximizing the organic shareholder value contribution of all of our global assets.We are in opposition to explore opportunities to drive capital market discipline down into every segment of our business, distinguishing between value creating and value consuming growth, and then focusing our strategies and investment, while driving economically profitable growth.',
                 'NDAQ': "I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Edward P. Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2018 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, General Counsel-North America and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC regulation update.I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.And now, I will turn the call over to Adena.Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will focus my remarks today on Nasdaq's business performance and how that tracks to the progress we're making across on our execution goals for the year. Before I detail our strong results for the quarter, I want to take a few minutes to discuss how Nasdaq is addressing two important issues, the Nordic commodity clearing default event and the SEC regulatory developments largely focused on U.S. equity market data.Turning first to the clearing event, on September 10, the markets in the German and Nordic Power experienced an extreme spread movement 17 times larger than the normal change in spread measured since 2011. As a result of the extreme price movement, a clearing member of our Nordic Commodities market incurred significant losses and failed to fully cover an intraday margin call within the prescribed time limit. Therefore, the member was declared in default. The default resulted in the loss to the clearinghouse net of the default member's collateral of €114 million. This loss was covered by the default waterfall, including €7 million from Nasdaq's Junior Capital or which is the first loss layer, and the remaining €107 million from the member default fund.By September 17, the member default fund was 100% replenished and Nasdaq implemented temporary Junior Capital, a first loss layer, of an additional €19 million on a 90-day basis. Nasdaq also announced that this time, a comprehensive examination of the event, which includes a review of its causes, the membership requirements, margin requirements, risk management procedures, collateral management, and default management procedures in an effort to learn everything we can to ensure that we are best positioned to avoid this type of situations from occurring again.This review has been conducted by a third party, Oliver Wyman, a global management consulting firm, with the support of our internal audit to ensure that we learn as much as possible with transparency and credibility. Once their review is complete, we plan to communicate our summary findings and recommended changes to the affected constituents.Our objective is to find the best model that balances the need to facilitate a robust market while, at the same time, providing members with assuredness that they can securely commit capital. At the same time, we're also working with our members on recovering a portion of the losses they incurred from the defaulting member, including liquidating the defaulting member's assets.We are grateful for the professional and constructive manner in which the market participants have worked with us throughout this difficult process and realize we have much to do to ensure their support going forward. We look forward to continuing to update everyone on a clear and timely basis as we work to reduce the financial impact of the default event on our members and enhance how the clearinghouse reduces risks in the future.Now, I'd like to turn to the regulatory developments regarding our SEC-regulated businesses which are largely focused on U.S. equity data products. First, I want to make clear that the debate, discussion, and developments in this area are part of what has been an almost 20-year story with regard to the data business in the context of the broader U.S. equity market structure. Today, I'll discuss the latest turns that have been a winding and largely court-litigated debate on the dynamics of a U.S. equity data product landscape which we feel is an important contributor to how U.S. stock markets deliver the highest levels of global standards in terms of efficiency, transparency and resiliency. We expect that this debate and related litigation will continue for many years to come.Let me talk first about last week's SEC actions and then discuss what we're doing to address them going forward and then how we're engaging with the industry as participants in the SEC market data and access roundtable later this week. Last Tuesday evening, the SEC rejected a 2016 decision by its own Chief Administrative Law Judge. The judge's original decision came after a one-week public administrative trial at the SEC. The administrative law judge ruled at the end of that trial that the price of exchange-created depth-of-book data is constrained by competition.",
                 'NOV': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.Loren SingletaryWelcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risk and uncertainty and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a US GAAP basis, for the third quarter of 2018, NOV reported revenues of $2.15 billion and net income of $1 million. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term, adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release.Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.Clay WilliamsThank you Loren. National Oilwell Varco's revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 2% and EBITDA increased $19 million to $245 million or 11.4% of revenue. While the company posted consolidated sequential improvement, our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. This was due to a combination of market headwinds which arose late in the quarter in North America, a sharper than anticipated falloff or product sales into offshore markets and a couple of self-inflicted execution challenges, which we were focused on fixing.Jose will go into these in more detail in just a few minutes, but generally our completion and production solutions segment saw completion services customers slow deliveries of pressure pumping units, spares and coiled tubing strings in September in North America. Some of these revenues were pushed out into the fourth quarter as deferred units are delivered but nevertheless, we recognize that our North American customers for this equipment are facing lower day rates in pricing. It began slowing acceptance of equipment on order and cutting expenditures to manage their cash flows over the past few weeks. The completion and production solutions segment's offshore products also showed significantly lower sequential sales, which were partially offset by much higher sales of fiberglass pipe and completion tools at good incrementals throughout the third quarter.The wellbore technologies group achieved its expectations for revenue, but with a different mix owing to some tool shipments that didn't make it out by the end of the quarter, which was roughly offset by higher drill pipe and drilling fluid sales. Margins for the group were below expectations due to mix and inflationary forces around labor and steel. We been less successful than we anticipated at passing on higher costs as our customers are pushing back hard on price increases.Rig Technologies posted better than expected margins compared to guidance despite lower revenues, owing to a higher mix of aftermarket revenue associated with land rig demand and offshore rig reactivation activities as well as better execution on offshore projects. These revenue gains were offset by lower than expected revenues on a lower margin land rig, which was expected to ship in the third quarter, but did not which shifted revenues to later periods.Overall NOV's EBITDA improved 8% sequentially. While EBITDA is going in the right direction, we are focused on delivering better results as we continue to position the company for future growth, which we expect to unfold in 2018. Before Jose goes into our detailed financial results for the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes offering color into some of our major geographic markets, beginning with North America.46% of NOV's consolidated revenues came from North America during the third quarter, reflecting sequential growth of 7% or $66 million. U.S. revenues increased 6% sequentially in Canada. Seasonal improvement produced 17% sequential growth. Within the North America directional drilling market, downhole tools saw increase sales with share gains in both bits and downhole drilling motors. Our high torque, high flow rate ERT motors continued to win share and we are seeing more operators rent motors directly from us as opposed to relying on directional drilling service providers to supply them.The strong performance of our motors has led to a 30% increase in power section sales year-to-date and our first half price increases appear to be holding, at least for these products. On the other hand, MWD spares sales into North America slowed in the third quarter after strong performance through the first half. Drill pipe saw double-digit sequential revenue growth and 58% of our global drill pipe bookings were for the U.S. markets in the third quarter as we achieved our highest level of Delta premium connection sales to-date at $44 million.",
                 'NKTR': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Ruddock, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Jennifer Ruddock Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With us are Howard Robin, our President and CEO; Gil Labrucherie, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Doberstein, our Head of R&D; Dr. Jonathan Zalevsky, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Dr. Mary Tagliaferri, our Chief Medical Officer.On today's call, we expect to make forward-looking statements regarding our business, including the timing of future clinical trials and clinical trial results, clinical development plans, including the plans or the future clinical trials, the therapeutic potential of certain drugs and drug candidates, as well as those of our partners, our financial guidance for 2018 and certain other statements regarding the future of our business. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks, that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Important risks and uncertainties are set forth in the Form 10-Q that we filed on August 9th, 2018, which is available at sec.gov. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. A webcast of this call will be available on the IR page at Nektar's website at nektar.com.With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Howard Robin. Howard?Howard Robin Thank you, Jennifer and thank you for everyone for joining us today for our third quarter 2018 conference call. On today's call, we will review our accomplishments in 2018 to-date, and also our planned milestones over the coming months, including the initiation of the broad registrational program for NKTR-214, which includes multiple trials during this year in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancers, as well as a new expansion arm in PIVOT enrolling second-line non-small cell lung cancer patients. We will also reiterate our financial guidance for the remainder of 2018.As you know, we're planning to presenting data at this weekend SITC Meeting in Washington DC for stage IV melanoma patients being treated with NKTR-214, plus OPDIVO from the PIVOT study. The presentation will include a number of important metrics, including depth of responses over time, as well as the complete response rate and disease control rate for the population. We will host a call on Saturday morning at 9 AM, following the oral presentation of updated efficacy, safety and biomarker data of the evening before.On the call, we will represent the data from the previous evening's oral session. Dr. Harriet Kluger of the Yale Cancer Center and Dr. Adi Diab of MD Anderson Cancer Center will join us to review Dr. Diab's presentation and discuss our Phase 3 trial in melanoma patients, which is under way. In addition, we will also be presenting early data from the first patients in the REVEAL trial, evaluating NKTR-262, plus NKTR-214.As we stated last quarter, as data from each of the PIVOT cohorts and other tumor types mature over in the next 6 months to 18 months, Nektar and Bristol are planning to present each of the datasets at various medical meetings, including tumor-specific conferences. We are currently planning the next presentation of PIVOT data from our bladder cancer cohorts at the upcoming ASCO GU Meeting in February of 2019. We continue to be very excited about the data being generated in the PIVOT trial and the future potential of NKTR-214 as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology.I'll start today by reviewing the multiple successes we've achieved over our pipeline of Nektar-invented medicines across three therapeutic areas; immuno-oncology, immunology and pain. So first let me cover NKTR-181. We will recognize the severe opioid epidemic that is facing our country right now. One significant building block to addressing this crisis is providing new pain medications that don't carry the same profiles as these existing opioid medications on the market.We continue to work closely with the FDA during the review of NKTR-181 as we've done throughout its developments. And as a reminder, our PDUFA date is May 29th and we currently understand the FDA plans to hold an Advisory Committee Meeting to review our NDA. However, we have not been given a date for this meeting yet. As I stated last quarter, we are in the process of establishing a separate commercial subsidiary with one or more capital partners to launch this important molecule. We believe this will allow us to ensure the commercial launch of NKTR-181 is optimized and we continue to be very excited about the future for NKTR-181.Now let's talk about immuno-oncology. We remain focused on our strategy to develop a full pipeline of new potential medicines that addressed the key components of the immune cycle in order to restore immune surveillance and properly harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. With this year's collaboration for NKTR-214 with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are now at an exceptionally strong financial position, which allows us to execute on our vision for Nektar's portfolio in immuno-oncology. The Bristol-Myers' collaboration gives us a unique and broad platform for us to rapidly develop our lead I-O candidate, Nektar-214.",

In the data-driven digital era, customers require solutions for a complex world, where data resides in the data center, in multiple clouds, at the enterprise edge and in externally linked applications and platforms.Our competitors are struggling to adapt to this new era of IT, and lacking a deeply cloud-integrated strategy will continue to fall behind. With the NetApp Data Fabric, we help customers simplify and integrate data management across multiple clouds, data centers and Edge to accelerate digital transformation and address their top IT imperatives, modernizing storage through data management, building next-generation data centers and harnessing the power of the hybrid cloud.Our focus enables us to accelerate growth by prioritizing investments and execution against the biggest opportunities. This success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which was 70% of net product revenue in Q3, up 26% year-over-year.As we indicated on our last call, headwinds from mature solutions have abated. In Q3, mature solutions contributed 30% of net product revenue, flat year-over-year. The shift to flash creates enormous new opportunity for us as we consolidate and displace competitor's legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments and upgrade our install base.",
                 'NFLX': "ntationSpencer WangAs a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.With that, over to you now Eric, for the first question.Question-and-Answer SessionQ - Eric SheridanThank you, Spencer. Maybe I'll kick off with what clearly is the headline from the earnings results, much better subscriber performance in Q3, and a fairly robust guide within Q4 in terms of looking out on the subscribers. I'll turn it to you guys to sort of layout the framework you saw develop in Q3, what do you think might develop in Q4 that was different than what happened earlier in the year?Reed HastingsEric, I think we’re getting a little better on the forecasting in particular the evolution to paid net ads. So if you look at that paid net ad growth that we showed, you can see how remarkably steady. So I'm afraid the Q2, Q3 story is probably mostly an issue of forecasting as opposed to anything changing in the business, and you can see the noise that the free trials added into the paid, which gets you the total creates. So I think by focusing going forward on paid, we'll be able to be a little more accurate and focused on the fundamentals.Eric SheridanSo when you think about some of the distribution deals you've done over the last couple of years, that's creating some noise that I think you're now trying to clear up with these new disclosures. But can you also talk a little bit about what those distribution deals maybe in terms of opening up packets of the market that haven't been available to you before not only just this year, but as you think out longer-term about the business?Reed HastingsSure. Over to you Greg.Greg PetersAnd can you clarify, Eric, in distribution deals you mean the device partners, et cetera.Eric SheridanCorrect. Different ways of going to market via partner as opposed to direct.Greg PetersYes. So I think what we are doing is, we are slowly learning more and more about how we can leverage partners. We've seen it sort of an evolution from just doing device integrations and to things like billing integrations, so we can make it that much easier for our members to sign up for the service. This latest round we're seeing now is bundling where whether we’re bundling with an Internet service provider or a mobile operator or pay-TV operator. We can make it even easier for people to just find Netflix and to try the service out.And what we're seeing here is that this allows us to access a set of subscribers, a consumer demographic which might be less technology early adopter than the folks that are signing us up – with us directly, and so we're able to sort of accelerate our growth in a new segment via these deals. So we're learning more and more about that, we're trying to figure out which markets they work and how to optimize that bundle strategy.David WellsEric, I would say these aren't new disclosures in a sense that that's pretty strong term. I would say this is an evolution of a partner strategy, and as Greg talked about, we've been doing many of these for a while. There's nothing sort of strategically different than what we've been doing for the last five years or so.Eric SheridanAnd maybe following up on something that Greg said there, just where you're discovering growth and awareness of the product that didn't exist before. I'd like to separate that into domestic versus international. I think one of the questions we get from investors all the time are, where is the growth coming from in North America given the brands awareness, given how long the brand has been around in the marketplace. Anything you could tell us about where those pockets of growth are and where you're discovering new awareness for the Company?Greg PetersI’d say even in America, where the awareness is super high and the brand is well understood. There's still pockets of consumers who – it's harder for them to get the activation energy to go directly to the website and sign up, but if we can actually put a Netflix application, a call to action and maybe even bundle that the service subscription as part of their pay-TV offering or the mobile offering, they can just click on something and then get right into the service.And so even for a place where we’re well known, we make it easier or more effective for our folks to sign up. We see actual acceleration of ads there. Then obviously in markets where we're less well understood in terms of what the offering is, that simplifying, that making it less friction full provides other types of members maybe that are even more technology adopters, simple way is just to try to experience out and we get the growth there as well.",
                 'NWL': 'I will now turn the conference call over to Ms. Nancy O\'Donnell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. O\'Donnell, you may begin ma\'am.Nancy O\'Donnell - Newell Brands, Inc.Thank you. Hello everybody. Thanks for joining us.

These statements are only predictions. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties and I\'d point you to our press release and SEC filings, which discuss these risks. We undertake no obligation to disseminate any updates to these statements. I\'d also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website and our earnings release for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.Thank you. And now, I\'ll turn it over to Mike.Michael B. Polk - Newell Brands, Inc.Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, I\'ll address our third quarter results, as well as the progress we\'re making on our Accelerated Transformation Plan. Ralph will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance and I will address our fourth quarter outlook before opening it up for your questions.Over the last few quarters, we\'ve had to confront several significant external factors, including the Toys"R"Us bankruptcy, changes in the Writing retailer landscape, U.S. trade conflict and emergence of tariffs as well as FX headwinds. Our team has been working hard to address these challenges head-on. And in the third quarter, we\'ve made good progress.As a reminder, we\'re focused on five core areas. First, returning the business to a consistent pattern of delivery. This means setting appropriate milestones and delivering against them, making our numbers quarter-by-quarter. Second, we\'re working hard to optimize our cost structure by delivering on our ongoing savings programs and extracting to retain costs related to the divestitures, we will and have made as we transform our portfolio.Third, we\'re focused on increasing cash flow by driving profitable growth, making meaningful progress in working capital and reducing the complexity across our business. Fourth, we are reshaping and focusing the portfolio on our most attractive consumer businesses, executing the divestitures and using the proceeds to delever and repurchase shares. And fifth, we are repositioning the organization for more consistent and sustained operating performance, restructuring division and function designs, while simultaneously strengthening and upgrading talent.In the third quarter, we made progress in all five of these areas. Specifically, we delivered sequential improvement in core sales growth in all segments in all regions with Writing returning to growth and e-commerce, excluding the absence of Toys"R"Us, U.S. Baby Registry growing double digits. We delivered 13% normalized operating margins, exceeding our expectations and year ago performance. Despite increased inflation, the July round of tariffs and the negative impact of foreign exchange.Pricing and productivity were positive contributors in the quarter and we made substantial progress on overheads through efforts to right-size the organization. We delivered over $570 million of operating cash flow, an increase of $389 million versus prior year as a result of good progress on inventories and on payables as efforts to renegotiate payment terms on sourced finished goods have begun to take effect. And we completed the divestiture of Rawlings and Waddington late in the second quarter and Goody this quarter, generating $2.6 billion in after-tax proceeds. In that context, we paid down nearly $900 million in debt, exiting the quarter with net debt down $2.5 billion versus prior year. We completed a tender offer for another $1 billion debt in October and we passed back over $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our share count in the third quarter was about 4% lower than year ago.As for the remaining non-core businesses, we\'re well along on the sales process for several with others beginning to take shape. We\'re on track to deliver about $10 billion in after-tax proceeds through these divestitures and we\'ll use the proceeds coupled with our operating cash flow after investment in the business to continue to de-lever and also buy back shares at very attractive prices.On our fifth priority, over the last two quarters, we\'ve taken steps to right-size our organization, actioning change in several functions including IT, marketing, R&D, design, and e-commerce. We\'ve made the difficult, but necessary decision to restructure and those actions have contributed to our professional head count on the continuing businesses being down by about 10% compared to where we stood at the beginning of the year. We are laser-focused on strengthening the operational performance and financial flexibility of the company. While we know we have much more work to do, third quarter was one of sequential progress. We will continue to execute with a sense of urgency in repositioning Newell Brands for sustainable growth. And in the quarters to come, we will turn the page on this challenging chapter in our history.',
                 'NEM': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.Turning to slide 2, before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes: delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently; sustaining a global portfolio of long-life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on four continents; and leading in profitability and responsibility.Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost two decades, and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team.More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over five years ago which has reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with the focus on capital discipline and industry leading returns.Turning back to the third quarter details on slide 4, the first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year, as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program and advancing our three most promising digital initiatives including: Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations.The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the third quarter: in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrate project; in South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September, and mining continues on schedule; in Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study; and in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project, and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter.Finally, we've continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold in order to serve mining projects in Colombia. We remain excited about Colombia's prospective gold districts, and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project, which does not currently meet our expectations.The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we were recognized as the Mining Sector Leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations.Turning to slide 5, while the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up, as there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verifications to critical controls with a completion rate of 99% year-to-date.So, previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again, highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including: minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources like water; demonstrating best practices in Corporate Governance, codes of business conduct, and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development, so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow.",
                 'NWSA': "Good day, everyone and welcome to News Corp Third Quarter Fiscal ‘18 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.Michael FlorinOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.Robert ThomsonThank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. The company continues to deliver on its strategic mission to become increasingly global and digital with an ever greater focus on collaboration and innovation and that focus is evident from this quarter's results.We are particularly pleased with the progress in digital real estate where revenues grew 27% and we fortified the business for future growth. Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $182 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.It is worth highlighting that for the first nine months, reported revenues were 6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by non-cash write downs of 998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, non-cash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America marketing.Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the digital real estate services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel, Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues, the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of a volatile advertising market.The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corps, under the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.The end of Google's prejudicial first click free policy, which punished high quality journalism, has already benefited our masters and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is however just a first step on the pathway to prominence. We and other publishers are also in discussion with Facebook, which certainly [indiscernible] about virtue and veracity. Well, authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance and experience what has been polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board, which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. These algorithms are already potent, but they are destined to be much more formidable and there are abundance potential to skew news and skewer customers’ needs to be better understood and monitored. And an algorithm review board or ARB would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our masters, our journalism and our advertising clients. We are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.Now, let's examine in more detail this quarter’s results. I'll start with digital real estate services, which continued to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter and Tracey Fellows and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients, while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the side. REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by emerging financial services business. ",

And good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks on the third quarter results, I would like to say a few words about Hurricane Florence and Michael. As you know, residents of the Southeastern US were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those who have been impacted by these storms’ widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several 1,000 of our employees and contractors to support the restoration efforts of our neighboring utilities. In addition, FPL was able to quickly resource service to the approximately 70,000 customers who were impacted by Hurricane Michael as the hardening and automation investments at FPL was made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continue to benefit customers. Now, turning to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results. And building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, remains well positioned to achieve our overall objectives for 2018. NextEra Energy’s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.33 or approximately 18% against the prior year quarter, reflecting strong execution of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Year-to-date we have grown adjusted earnings per share by approximately 14% compared to the prior year comparable period, as we continue to execute well on our major initiatives. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.18 year-over-year. Strong growth was driven by continued investment in the business to maintain our best-in-class customer value preposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. Consistent with our expectations, we achieved our target regulatory ROE of 11.6% early in the third quarter. All of our major capital initiatives remain on track including the 1,750 megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and construction of four 74.5 megawatt solar energy centers that are currently being built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment or SOBRA mechanism of the rate case settlement agreement. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Florida City Gas, and welcomed its employees and customers to the NextEra Energy family. As a reminder, starting this quarter, financial results for FCG are being reported as part of our FPL business segment. The proposed acquisitions of Gulf Power and ownership stakes in two natural gas power plants continue to progress well. In September, the Federal Trade Commission granted Early Termination of the Waiting Period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust requirements. In addition, the change of control proceedings with FERC are currently uncontested. Subject to obtaining the FERC approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions, we continue to expect the Gulf Power transaction to close in the first half of 2019. Assuming the transactions close, financial results for the natural gas plants will be reported as part of Energy Resources and Gulf Power will be reported as its own business segment. ",
                 'NLSN': "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Sara Gubins, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.Sara Gubins - Nielsen Holdings PlcThanks, Carol.

I'll make some brief opening remarks and then turn the call over to Dave for a review of the third quarter financials and to share his perspectives on the company.First, the strategic review. As we announced in September, the board of directors expanded the scope of our previously announced strategic review of the company's Buy segment to include a broad review of strategic alternatives for the entire company and its businesses. As we've stated, the strategic review could result in a broad range of alternatives, including continuing to operate as a public, independent company; a separation of either Nielsen's Watch or Buy segments; or a sale of the entire company.We are working with a great deal of focus and urgency on this review and have engaged a team of expert outside advisors, including JPMorgan, Guggenheim, BCG and Wachtell Lipton, to assist us in a fulsome analysis of our historical and forward-looking financials as well as our strategy, markets and strategic alternatives. Our board, with the assistance of our advisors and management, is engaged in directly overseeing the strategic review, and we've also designated a group of independent directors to meet regularly with our advisors and members of management to help drive the process. We do not have any additional details to share at this point, but we are working expeditiously and will provide further updates as appropriate.Second, the CEO search. This is a parallel process to the strategic review, and the search is well under way. I must say I've been very impressed with the quality of the candidates we've seen to date. The recent hire of Dave is a testament to our ability to attract top talent, despite some obvious challenges in the business.As you know, Mitch Barns will remain as CEO through the end of the year or until a new CEO is appointed. Mitch continues to be actively engaged in driving the business forward on a day-to-day basis. We thank Mitch for his dedication and continued commitment to Nielsen and all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.Third, we made a fantastic hire with Dave Anderson, who joined us in September. Dave is well-known to the investment community from his 11-year tenure at Honeywell, one of the world's largest industrial companies. Throughout his career, he has helped develop and successfully implement strategies for growth and operational improvements in extremely complex environments. Dave is a tremendous addition to our team and has hit the ground running.",

Thanks for your cooperation on this.I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.Mark ParkerThanks Nitesh and good afternoon everyone. I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment.I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the Nike brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an advisor through this transition until he retires in August. And I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the Nike brand around the world.We have a deep leadership bench at Nike and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense.So with that this call will be led by our CFO Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward. Simply put the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2x innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2x direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts leading with our mobile apps, dotcom and digital partners. And through 2x speed, we're serving consumers at their pace.During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets. And in this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%.The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new Nike consumer experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there is a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct offense and triple double strategy. The momentum we're building in all four geographies is a result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect, our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace the greater the returns. So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the triple double and fueling our growth in our key categories.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.Information concerning such risks and uncertainties is included in the MD&A and Risk Factors sections of our periodic SEC filings. In addition, some of the statements made on this recording relate to non-GAAP measures. For additional information on the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of these measures, please refer to the supplemental slides and additional segment information, including our full financial schedules available at nisource.com.With all that out of the way, I'd like to now turn the call over to Joe.Joseph J. Hamrock - NiSource, Inc.Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As most of you know in the period since our last investor call NiSource and our customers in the Greater Lawrence, Massachusetts, area experienced an event of unprecedented proportions. This tragic event has been a humbling experience for all of us at NiSource and Columbia Gas, and we realized that much work lies ahead of us to finish our service restoration in Greater Lawrence, and regain the trust of our customers and the communities we serve.In Greater Lawrence, we continue to stay keenly focused on helping our customers and restoring the impacted communities. We are committed to restoring service to customers there safely and as quickly as possible.Safety and the care of our customers is the very foundation of our business. Although, the reviews of this incident are not complete, we are taking steps across our seven-state footprint to enhance system safety. Those measures include procedures and protocols that help guard low pressure systems from the risks that can lead to overpressure incidents with emphasis on enhanced project designs, controls and risk management and enhanced damage prevention protocols. In addition, the plan includes responsive measures such as designs that would automatically shut down an infected system or otherwise protect customer property in the event of an overpressure situation.Across NiSource, our teams continue working to enhance safety for our customers and communities and our team in Indiana is taking significant steps to advancing our long-term electric business strategy.Let's now turn to slide 3, which outlines some of our key accomplishments in the third quarter and early fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP net operating earnings, which excludes the impact of the Greater Lawrence event were $0.10 per share in the third quarter versus $0.07 in 2017, which keeps us on plan to achieving our net operating earnings per share guidance of a $1.26 to a $1.32 for 2018. And we remain on plan to invest $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in our regulated utility infrastructure in 2018.We are also reaffirming our long-term guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in annual capital investments and 5% to 7% annual growth in net operating earnings and dividends per share through 2020. As of Tuesday, we've replaced all 45 miles of distribution pipeline and all of the service lines necessary to restore service to the impacted communities, in Lawrence, Massachusetts.Additional work is necessary to make homes and businesses House Ready in order to restore service to all the impacted customers. We're working diligently with our business partners to marshal the resources necessary and adjust our approach to meet our customers' needs and finish this important work safely and as quickly as possible. Meanwhile our teams have continued their disciplined execution of our infrastructure modernization programs and regulatory initiatives across all our states.Just yesterday, we achieved two milestones in our electric business in Indiana. We submitted our latest Integrated Resource Plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and also filed a base rate case, which supports the plans we outlined in the Integrated Resource Plan. And we continue to execute on both, our environmental investments and our long-term transmission and distribution system modernization program.In our gas business, we received approval of our rate case settlement in Indiana, and settlements are pending in our Maryland and Pennsylvania base rate cases. We've filed a new rate case in Virginia and withdrew our pending rate case in Massachusetts. In Ohio, we've reached a settlement agreement in our Capital Expenditure Program rider case. We continue to execute on our infrastructure modernization programs across our footprint and our application for a long-term program extension in Maryland was also approved.",
                 'NBL': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.Thanks, Alison, and thank you all for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. I hope you've had a chance to review the earnings release and supplement that we published this morning. The press release and slides are available on the Investors page of our website. And later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.I want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO, will provide this morning's prepared comments. And we will have plenty of time for a Q&A session. Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliot, SVP of Offshore, are here to participate in the Q&A session.With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I will start by stating what I hope is obvious. Over the past month, we have seen tremendous volatility from market concerns about global trade impacts, supply uncertainties from the pending Iran sanctions and overall capital efficiency questions about this industry. The market disconnect from energy stocks and commodity price seems overdone.Over the last few weeks, the U.S. public E&P space has lost approximately $100 billion in market cap, which is truly astonishing to me, in light of where oil prices are and the growing uncertainty as to whether supply can keep pace with global demand over the next few years. This is despite the fact that we are seeing more commitment to shareholder returns and capital discipline than I can remember, against a backdrop of constructive oil market fundamentals.For Noble Energy, we have evolved and deliberately transformed our portfolio to be competitive in any environment, and remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders. The diversification in our asset base provides multiple options to allocate capital to the highest margin, highest return opportunities, leveraging our high-quality onshore assets as well as global pricing exposure with Equatorial Guinea and Israel. While accomplishing this portfolio transformation, we have also paid down substantial debt, enhanced our financial flexibility and accelerated the return of capital to shareholders.We are well on our way to achieving our 2018 objectives. Execution was strong in the third quarter, as we delivered volumes at the high end, while capital and costs were at the low end of our guidance. Year-over-year, we generated nearly 30% operating cash flow growth. The cash flow growth number is even higher on a debt-adjusted per share basis, resulting from debt reduction in excess of $1 billion and a decrease in shares outstanding from the buy-back program. Looking back, our quarterly operating cash flow generated was the highest it's been in four years.Within the third quarter, we progressed a number of items across our global operations that create near and long-term value. Starting with the U.S. Onshore, we delivered record liquid volumes, substantially grew cash flows and maintained disciplined capital spending. In the DJ Basin, we advanced our Mustang IDP development, with 31 wells now online. These wells are currently producing a gross rate of 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an oil mix of over 60%. Productivity from the first row of Mustang highlights the quality of our acreage and will contribute to continued growth in the fourth quarter from the DJ Basin.Earlier this week, we received regulatory approval for our Comprehensive Drilling Plan for 100 square mile position in Mustang. This provides full operational control, ability to accelerate permits and efficiency advantages across this contiguous 75,000 net acre. I want to acknowledge and thank our teams, as this is the first Comprehensive Drilling Plan of this scale approved.Also, we've strategically positioned our operations in the DJ to diversify across multiple gas processors. Within the third quarter, we began to see the benefit of gas processing expansion with DCP's Mewbourne plant that started up in August and ramped throughout the quarter. We also benefited from utilizing multiple outlets for our gas flow. Looking forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the processing capacity additions coming online later this quarter and in the first half of 2019.In the Delaware Basin, sales volumes in the third quarter more than doubled from the prior year, driven by continued strong Wolfcamp A well productivity across the acreage position. Over the last year, we've built out the necessary central gathering infrastructure to support our activity. These facilities, operated by Noble Midstream, are contributing to enhanced capital efficiency. In addition, we have secured long-haul takeaway on the EPIC Pipeline that will provide access to premium priced Gulf Coast markets, anticipated to begin in the third quarter of 2019.",
                 'JWN': 'At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Trina Schurman, Director of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may begin.Trina SchurmanGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today’s earnings call will last 45 minutes and will include around 30 minutes for your questions. Participating in today’s call are Blake Nordstrom, Co-President; and Anne Bramman, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss the Company’s third quarter performance and the outlook for 2018.Before we begin, I want to mention that we’ll be referring to slides which can be viewed by going to nordstrom.com in the Investor Relations section. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slides showing our Safe Harbor language.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Blake.Blake NordstromGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We’re focused on our aspiration to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world through our three strategic pillars; one, providing a compelling product offering; two, delivering exceptional services and experiences; and three, leveraging the strength of our Nordstrom brand. For the third quarter, we achieved total sales growth of 3% and a comp sales increase of 2.3%. This demonstrated ongoing strength and our full price and off price businesses. Our early investments in our digital capabilities are paying off. The combination of our digital capabilities and local market assets have enabled us to be at the forefront of serving customers on their terms. Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of nordstrom.com. This business has grown to roughly 2.5 million visitors per day, ranking among the top 10 ecommerce retailers in the United States. Year-to-date, overall digital sales grew 20% and made a 30% of our business.Before I provide an update on our key initiatives, I’d like to address the estimated earnings per share charge of $0.28 taken in the third quarter. In a recent review of credit card accounts, we identified some cardholders with delinquent accounts being charged higher interest in there. We estimate that less than 4% of Nordstrom cardholders will receive a refund or credit with most receiving less than $100. We have taken action including the appropriate steps to ensure the problem is addressed and does not happen again.We sincerely apologize to these cardholders. We realized customers and shareholders place a great deal of trust in us and that’s a responsibility we take seriously. Excluding this charge, our third quarter earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations and Anne will provide further details of this matter in her remarks.Looking ahead, we’re scaling generational investments in our digital businesses and new markets. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Trunk Club has delivered sales growth of nearly 50% year-to-date, demonstrating successful efforts to improve the customer offer. We continued our expansion into Canada with three additional racks in Toronto, Edmonton and Ottawa. Our six rack stores open to date are performing ahead of our expectations.We expect further synergies from having a full price and off price presence in this market. Last spring, we took our first step in serving customers in Manhattan with our men store. We’re building on our initial learnings as we focus on expanding our presence in this premier retail market with our flagship women’s store opening planned in fall 2019. Our strategy in our local markets is another cornerstone of how we will win with customers and drive increased shareholder value. Through our focus on our top markets, we are leveraging our inventory along with our digital and store capabilities to serve customers in new and relevant ways.We’re on track with our rollout beginning in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that when executed at scale, we can better serve customers, driving market share gains, engagement, and improve profitability. Last month, we introduced Get It Fast, a new feature that gives customers the significantly expanded view of merchandise selection that’s available next day in the Los Angeles market. Since the launch, we have seen a 50% lift in buy online and pickup in store. This is a great example of how we’re leveraging our digital and physical capabilities to increase convenience for our customers. Enabled by our supply chain investments, we have potential to increase selection by four times to seven times for product available, same or next day in a given market.To support customers on the West Coast, we recently announced plans to open a new fulfillment center and a local omni-channel hub next year.These facilities should increase inventory efficiencies. And more importantly, they should significantly improve the customer experience by getting product to them faster. Nordstrom Local, which are small neighborhood hubs provide customers with more convenient access to our services.',
                 'NSC': "Clay Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call.Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman President and CEO, Jim Squires.James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer.Starting with our financial highlights on slide 4. We delivered another quarter of record financial results. Income from operations was over $1 billion, an increase of 14%. Net income was $702 million, up 39% over the prior year. And earnings per share was $2.52, a 44% increase.The operating ratio of 65.4% is a third quarter record for our company and marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement. As 2018 draws to a close, we are poised to achieve another year of solid OR improvement and strong bottom line results.Given the progress we've made in the last three years and the likelihood we will meet our current financial goals well ahead of schedule, we are moving forward on the next round of initiatives to drive shareholder value. We look forward to briefing you on these new initiatives and the associated financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day on February 11 in Atlanta Georgia. Please save the date.Now to provide further insight into our third quarter results, Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will give you additional color on the state of operations and Cindy will detail our financial results.I'll now turn the call over to Alan.Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 6. The success of our market approach is clearly demonstrated by sustained growth revenue, revenue per unit, and volume. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains, with seven quarters of strengthening RPU and eight quarters of volume improvement. For five consecutive quarters we achieved steady year-over-year increases in RPU less fuel which is hugely important to operating income.We have succeeded despite the negative mix impact of continued strong volume growth in intermodal with balanced and consistent RPU increases in all three of our business units. The increase in intermodal RPU coupled with productivity improvements consistently enhances intermodal profitability, auguring well for the future given that intermodal remains one of the fast growing segments of the freight market.The strength of our multifaceted plan generated revenue, RPU and volume growth across most markets in our intermodal and merchandise business units. Our balanced focus on margin, price and volume continues to produce revenue growth, benefiting our top line as well as operating income.Slide 7 highlights the results of our plan that generated 10% revenue growth in the third quarter. This gain was the product of sustained volume improvements, higher pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. In merchandise we achieved record revenue, RPU, and RPU excluding fuel in the third quarter. Volume growth was led by gains in ethanol and crude oil. RPU grew year-over-year for the tenth consecutive quarter, highlighting our emphasis on pricing.For the fourth consecutive quarter, intermodal achieved record revenue with two consecutive quarters of 20% year-over-year growth. This increase was generated by records and volume and RPU less fuel. A strong economic environment coupled with a tight truck market continues to drive demand for Norfolk Southern's intermodal franchise, resulting in significant growth. Pricing gains led to substantial improvement in RPU less fuel and RPU during the quarter.Coal revenue was up 3% in the third quarter with positive pricing and export volume growth that was partially offset by declines in our utility market. Our strategy delivered strong results in the third quarter with revenue and RPU increases in every business group, underscoring our commitment to competitive pricing as well as our ability to capitalize on market conditions. The continued strength and improvement in our top line metrics illustrates the confidence customers have in our approach.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.Biff BowmanGood morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $374.5 million. Earnings per share were $1.58 and our return on common equity was 15.1%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter’s results included $8.1 million community development investment impairment within other operating income, $2.7 million of severance-related and restructuring charges within expenses, a $5.5 million tax benefit relating to adjustments recorded in the current quarter associated with IRS guidance issued with respect to the Tax Cuts and Job Act.Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a favorable impact on us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices increasing 15.7% and 2.3% respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices also increased with the S&P 500 up 7.2% and the EAFE up 1.8%. Also on a sequential basis, the average daily market value of the S&P 500 was up 5.4%, while the EAFE declined 0.2%. As you will recall, some of our fees are also based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was up 2.9%, while the EAFE was up 2.5%. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve as well as for the Bank of England. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 3% and 2% respectively compared to the prior year. The British pound and euro also declined sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of revenue and a favorable impact to expense.Let’s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 9% with non-interest income up 8% and net interest income up 14%. Expenses increased 7% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $9 million compared to a credit of $7 million 1 year ago. Net income was 26% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue declined 2% with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income down 1%. Expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 4% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 15.1% for the quarter, up from 12.2% 1 year ago, but down from 16.5% in the prior quarter.Assets under custody and administration of $10.8 trillion increased 12% compared to 1 year ago and increased 1% on a sequential basis. Approximately half of the year-over-year growth was driven by the acquisition of UBS Asset Management’s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.2 trillion increased 6% compared to 1 year ago and were up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable market impacts and new business partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.The sequential growth was primarily due to favorable markets partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows while the sequential increase was primarily related to favorable markets, partially offset by lower end of period securities lending collateral levels as well as unfavorable moves in currency exchange rate.Let’s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 9% from last year and down 2% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition revenue was up approximately 8% from last year. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $939 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down slightly from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition, fees were up approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis. Foreign exchange trading income was $72 million in the third quarter, up 46% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function as well as higher client volumes. The sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes.',

Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start the call by thanking our entire team for their continued focus on execution and performance. Our third quarter results demonstrated robust performance with topline growth and strong operational execution. The quarter included the first full quarter of results for Innovation Systems. Based on our strong performance, we're increasing our guidance for the year. Kathy and Ken will review the operational and financial results.I'm delighted to note that for the first time in a decade, the Department of Defense begins this fiscal year without a continuing resolution. The fiscal year 2019 defense appropriation bill received very strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate with a 93 to 7 vote. We view this support as well as the administration's focus on accelerating innovation efforts as signals that the Congress and the administration are aggressively addressing the threats emerging across multiple domains and are increasing our nation's pace of modernization and investment.Our own programs continue to be well supported in the budget, and our portfolio is well-balanced between mature franchise production efforts and the development programs that will ultimately lead to the next generation of production programs.In the context of an improving budget environment, we've aggressively invested in supporting our customers' need for advancing capabilities, including the addition of Innovation Systems, while also driving affordability. We're focused on performing on our current programs and pursuing attractive new programs in our robust opportunity set.Overall, I'm very pleased with our team's year-to-date accomplishments, and I'm excited about the many opportunities before us. I'm also excited about the future of our company under Kathy's leadership. She has demonstrated a solid focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, and she brings the leadership capabilities and values to lead our great company forward.So, let me turn the call over to Kathy to give us an update on our third quarter results. Kathy?Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.Thanks, Wes. Good afternoon, everyone. Wes, I want to first express our gratitude for the way you've led our team in creating value, while always maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity. On behalf of the entire Northrop Grumman team, we thank you.Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.Thanks, Kathy.Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.My comments today will address third quarter financial and operational highlights for each of the sectors, including a status on our Innovation Systems integration.Beginning with our financial results, the businesses generated solid topline growth and strong segment operating income and margin rates during the quarter. Sales increased 23% to $8.1 billion, reflecting a full quarter of Innovation Systems, as well as continued topline growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.I'd also note that international sales rose 22% year-to-date and we ended the quarter with total backlog of $52.6 billion. We continue to see strong demand from international customers. At the end of the third quarter, Japan announced their decision to purchase an additional nine E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, bringing their total planned E-2D purchase to 13 aircraft.Third quarter segment operating income increased 29% and our segment operating margin rate increased 60 basis points to 12.1%. In addition to this quarter's strong operating performance, third quarter financial results benefited from the settlement of cost claims as well as a lower tax rate. These factors combined to generate a 78% increase in third quarter net earnings and earnings per share.",

Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2018 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release.Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?Frank Del RioThank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2018 picked up with a second quarter left off. As a robust demand environment coupled with precision execution by our three brands lead to record revenue and earnings, and perhaps more importantly contributed to an acceleration of our 2019 record book position.It was a quarter where continued strong demand stimulated by cost effective marketing initiatives and another demand creation strategies, and led by a competent U.S. consumer combined with a multiple benefits of a mostly refurbished fleet and the introduction of Norwegian Bliss, the most successful newbuild in the Company's history, all confluence to generate the highest revenue and earnings of any quarter in our history.To put this milestone into proper perspective, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter just ended equal adjusted earnings per share for all of 2014, the year of the transaction have brought Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises into the Norwegian Cruise Line Holding family. I'm sure everyone will agree that the revenue and earnings growth of our Company of the last several years has been truly outstanding.Our third quarter results were buoyed by three main drivers. First, the blockbuster inaugural season of Norwegian Bliss; second, strong demand across our three brands, primarily from North Americans for voyages and premium destinations, particularly Europe; and third outstanding performance from our two upscale brands.Regarding Norwegian Bliss and to put it bluntly, the vessel is a gift that keeps on giving. The images of guests feeding on her double-decker go-karts racetrack with the Seattle skyline or Alaska’s majestic glazers in the background have become calling card to the brand, appearing in countless instagram fees worldwide and generating consumer interest in the Norwegian brand that no amount of money can buy.Bliss is outstanding financial performance, especially in onboard revenue, has exceeded even our highest expectations. Well on the ticket front, she has spearheaded the effort that drove a 25% plus pricing increase on the Norwegian brands, three ship Alaska deployment, despite a 15% capacity increase. As for the strong demand environment, it was led by a banner year for travel from the new to the old world.We were pleasantly surprised by the further acceleration of demand from North Americans wanting to cruise on Europe itineraries across our three brands. At the same time, the Norwegian brands innovative, premium, all inclusive products allowed us to attract a higher caliber European consumer at higher prices. That result is a second consecutive year of double-digit pricing growth for the all important Europe season.The performance of our two upscale brands, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises is equally impressive. On our last call, you'll recall we've mentioned that the two brands that already broached the 50% load factor mark for 2019.",

For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation.And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG.Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on slide 4.First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our transformation plan pro forma.Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to right-size our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformational plan, asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019.Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan.Moving to our third quarter business update on slide 5, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives while achieving top quartile safety results.I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility. As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.Our year-to-date result now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last two months.During the third quarter we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase, following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019. Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.Turning to slide 6 with our transformation plan update; we continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives.",
                 'NUE': "Certain statements made during this conference will be considered forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and information that is currently available. Although Nucor believes these are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy. More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website. These forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them, either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Ferriola, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead.John FerriolaGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call and for your interest in Nucor. Other members of Nucor's executive team are also on the call today, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Joe Stratman, our Chief Digital Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Ladd Hall, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Dave Sumoski, responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; Leon Topalian, responsible for Beam and Plate Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products.I will begin today's call by sharing with you the highlights from our third quarter. Jim Frias will then provide you more details about our financial performance. Nucor's strong financial performance continued into the third quarter with net earnings of $2.13 per diluted share and first nine months earnings of $5.35 per diluted share. We are on pace in 2018 to have a record year for earnings. Our financial results are evidence that Nucor was primed and ready for this long-awaited upturn in the steel market. Our strategic initiatives, including capital projects, acquisitions and enhanced customer engagement as well as our active participation in industry trade actions have solidified our market-leading performance. Our extensive investments have grown our peak earnings power and enhanced our many competitive strengths. Our growth and earnings capacity has been achieved in all three of our business segments: steel, downstream products and raw materials. These diverse earnings streams power our long-term, industry-leading returns on capital. The continued strength of the U.S. economy is the primary catalyst for our earnings growth. Tax and regulatory reform, along with a robust domestic energy sector, are driving this economy. 23 of the 24 end-use markets we monitor are experiencing stable to increasing demand. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see evidence of sustained strength in steel end-use markets. Our industry is also benefiting from the cumulative impact of years of successful trade cases that resulted in antidumping and countervailing duties as well as the very recently imposed Section 232 tariffs. Together, these are removing artificially low-cost foreign imports from the market and restoring a level playing field. Through the first nine months of 2018, finished steel imports are down approximately 11%. Finished steel import market share for this year's first nine months is 24%, down from 28% for the comparable year-ago period. Nucor's earnings growth is supported by our disciplined capital allocation practices. Our highest priority is to invest in profitable, long-term growth. We are currently implementing nine growth initiatives totaling approximately $2.2 billion. Completion dates for these projects range from 2019 through 2021. Four of these projects, totaling $750 million, are focused on the production of long products. These include the rebar rolling mill modernization in Ohio, the MBQ mill expansion in Illinois and the construction of two new rebar micro mills, one in Missouri and the other in Florida.Notable third quarter progress on these important growth projects included the successful startup of the new reheat furnace at the Ohio rolling mill modernization and completion of environmental permitting for the Missouri rebar micro mill. The remaining five projects, totaling $1.4 billion, are in our Sheet Mill group. They include a specialty cold rolling mill and additional galvanizing line in Arkansas, a galvanizing line in Mexico with our joint venture partner, JFE Steel, and a new galvanizing line and expanded hot band production capacity in Kentucky. Two of the projects are approaching completion in the first half of 2019, the Kentucky mill's new galvanizing line and the Arkansas mills specialty cold mill. The Gallatin, Kentucky project will position Nucor with the widest hot-rolled galvanizing line in North America and significantly boost our growth in automotive markets. The Hickman, Arkansas project expands our capability to produce advanced high-strength, high-strength low-alloy and motor lamination products. Let me share further details regarding our recently announced expansion of hot band production capacity at Nucor Steel Gallatin. The mill's current capacity is 1.6 million tons annually, which we are expanding to 3 million tons. The cost of the project is about $650 million. When completed, Gallatin will have the capability to produce bigger slabs, casting up to 5 inches and a maximum coil width of up to 73 inches. ",
                 'NVDA': "I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference.Simona JankowskiThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until November 22, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, November 15, 2018, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette.Colette KressThanks, Simona. Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize. Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal [segment] [ph] to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcement. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.The first two GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These two high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce 27D. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.",
                 'ORLY': "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tom McFall. Mr. McFall you may begin.Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.Thank you, Zenaira. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we'll discuss our third quarter 2018 results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018. After our prepared comments, we'll host a question-and-answer period.Before we begin this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements and we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimates, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend, or similar words.The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.At this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson.Gregory D. Johnson - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to O'Reilly Auto Parts third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our Chief Operating Officer and Co-President; and Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Henslee, our Executive Vice Chairman are also present.It's my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating team O'Reilly on a strong third quarter and a solid first nine months of 2018. The sales momentum we experienced in the first half of 2018 continued through the third quarter, and drove our comparable store sales increase of 3.9%, which was at the top-end of our guidance range.As a reminder, we faced a headwind in the third quarter from an additional Sunday as compared to 2017, which had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points since Sunday is our lowest volume day of the week. We're also pleased with our team's ability to generate year-to-date comparable store sales growth of 4% through their unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service.Our sales growth combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable sales and expense management generated a 5% increase in operating profit dollars as compared to the third quarter of 2017, and an operating margin of 19.5%. In addition to our solid growth in sales and operating profit, we were also the beneficiaries of a substantially lower tax rate than expected, which Tom will cover in his prepared comments.This combination of operating performance along with our ongoing share buyback program drove an increase in the third quarter earnings per share of 40% to $4.50 per share, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $4.30 and is a testament to our team's efforts to provide unsurpassed customer service.Now, I'd like to provide some additional color on our third quarter comparable store sales results. The composition of sales in the third quarter was very similar to the second quarter, and really the full year of 2018 as we have seen a very consistent and stable trend throughout the year.Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional performing at a stronger level as we saw strong ticket count growth on that side of the business again in the third quarter with the only sequential difference versus the second quarter resulting from the headwind of the additional Sunday.DIY ticket counts continue to see pressure as customers on that side of the business are more sensitive to increased gas prices and inflation, and are more likely to defer maintenance or repairs in the short-term, particularly for lower income DIY'ers.Average ticket continues to be a strong contributor to our comparable store sales increase on both sides of our business, driven by the increasing complexity of vehicle repairs, a favorable overall business mix and continued effective pricing management.Similar to the past two quarters, we benefited from some modest commodity-driven inflation on same SKU pricing in the quarter. We'll begin to see same SKU inflation accelerate as our industry passes through cost increases for the parts subject to the latest tariff, which went into effect on September 24, although, we are working with our suppliers to minimize and delay this impact.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements, as more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on slide 2.Our earnings press release, the Investor Relations supplemental schedules and our non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations, and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off our website at www.oxy.com.I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.Vicki A. Hollub - Occidental Petroleum Corp.Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.Today I'd like to begin by highlighting the results we've achieved over the last 12 months, during which our focus on value growth and our high-quality assets delivered a cash return on capital employed of 26%. Combined with a double-digit return on capital employed over the same period, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to deliver industry-leading returns and have aligned our executive compensation to this principle.Our integrated business model provides us with numerous opportunities in which to invest and grow free cash flow in a sustainable manner well into the future. We remain disciplined and will continue to allocate capital to investments that generate the highest returns for our shareholders. This approach enabled us to deliver $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders over the last year through a combination of our dividend and share repurchases while also growing production by 14%.This morning, Cedric will walk you through our financial results and updated guidance. Jeff will detail the sustainable and value-creating improvements we continue to create in the Permian. And prior to leading our Investor Relations, I just wanted to let you know that Jeff served as President and General Manager for two of our Resources business units, Texas Delaware and Midland Basin. He also has significant prior experience in our Enhanced Oil Recovery businesses. After Jeff, Ken will provide an update on operations and opportunities in our international businesses.Before covering our third quarter highlights, I would like to mention an organizational update and congratulate Jeff Bennett and Barbara Bergesen. They have recently taken on heightened roles within our Domestic Oil and Gas business. Jeff is leading our three Permian business units in the Midland Basin, Texas Delaware, and Southeast New Mexico. And Barb is leading our Permian Enhanced Oil Recovery business.I'd also like to congratulate Richard Jackson in his new role, which includes leading our new Low Carbon Ventures team along with our Permian competitor analysis, land, and regulatory teams. The Low Carbon Ventures team will work across all of our businesses. These changes will enable us to focus more intensely on the Permian and to develop unique corporate strategies that address the key challenges facing our industry.As noted on slide 5, we delivered an exceptional quarter both financially and operationally. Our operating cash flow of $2.6 billion exceeded capital and dividends by $700 million. And during the third quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders. Our earnings per share of $1.77 is the highest quarterly EPS we have achieved since the second quarter of 2014, when the average WTI oil price was over $100. All of our business segments exceeded key performance targets through production growth in the most profitable areas, lower unit cost, and better price realizations.In Permian Resources, we brought our best well to date online in the Greater Sand Dunes area. And in Barilla Draw, we brought online the best Texas Permian well to date for the industry. These achievements were made possible through the investments we've made in our people and the advances they have achieved in subsurface modeling and characterization.In Oman, we have three new blocks that will provide us long-term, short-cycle, lower-decline growth opportunities. Ken will provide additional information on these later in the presentation.Our Chemicals segment produced another record quarter of earnings as a result of our integrated business model, which allows us to take full advantage of favorable market conditions. Our Midstream and Marketing business continues to deliver high realizations from our advantaged Permian takeaway position. And as expected, we closed on the previously announced $2.6 billion Midstream transactions.",
                 'OMC': 'Shub MukherjeeGood morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Phil Angelastro, Chief Financial Officer.We hope everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release. We have posted to www.omnicomgroup.com this morning’s press release along with the presentation, covering the information that we will review this morning. This call is also being simulcast and will be archived on our website.Before we start, I have been asked to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation and to point out that certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and that these statements are our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially.I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom’s performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We are going to begin this morning’s call with an overview of our business from John Wren. Then, Phil Angelastro will review our financial results for the quarter. And then we will open up the line for your questions.John WrenThank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call this morning. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2018 results. It’s been a very busy quarter as we successfully executed many of the repositioning plans and dispositions that we discussed on our last call on July 17. On August 31, we completed the previously announced disposal of Sellbytel. In addition, during the third quarter, we disposed of 18 other companies, which were primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline and to a lesser extent in our CRM consumer experience discipline. These businesses were no longer aligned with our long-term strategy. The disposition activity resulted in a net gain to our P&L in the quarter which Phil will cover during his remarks.With respect to the company’s results, we reduced headcount by approximately 7,000 people. We also accelerated certain planned cost reduction and real estate consolidation activities in the quarter. During the quarter, we took actions to reduce our staff in our ongoing operations by over 1,400 people with annual payroll of approximately 135 million. These staff actions fell into three general categories. Approximately 500 positions will be replaced as we refresh and upgrade our talent to meet our agency’s current needs. The retirement of a number of senior executives in our networks, practice areas and at Omnicom corporate, these retirements ensure that our succession plans are up-to-date and that we are creating opportunities for upcoming leaders and the savings from the remaining reductions in the headcount will contribute to our goal of offsetting the EBIT loss from the dispositions we completed in the quarter.During the quarter, we also accelerated our real estate consolidation plans by creating more large open and modern campus style hubs, encouraging greater cross-agency collaboration. This move has resulted in efficiencies by allowing us to vacate more than 400,000 square feet in several cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, New York and London. In addition to discussing the net gain from our disposition activity, Phil will address the repositioning costs we incurred in the quarter associated with the staff and real estate actions. Looking forward we expect that the reduction to our EBIT from the dispositions we completed will be substantially offset by savings achieved from our cost reduction and real estate consolidation actions. We continued to evaluate the portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities as well as to identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses or potential disposition.Turning now to our third quarter results, prior to the end of the second quarter we began to hold discussions with interested buyers and the managers of many of the companies we disposed during the third quarter. As you would expect given the activity related to preparing for the dispositions the managers for these businesses were distracted causing a decline in the performance of these businesses during the quarter, the impact of the dispositions reduced overall organic growth by 0.40% in the quarter and reduced organic growth in the U.S. by 0.60% in the quarter. Assuming all of our third quarter dispositions had occurred on July 1 we had total organic growth of 3.3% for the quarter and 1.2% in the U.S. for the quarter which better reflects the performance of the portfolio companies that we now have.',
                 'OKE': "Andrew ZiolaThank you, Katie, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings.Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry?Terry SpencerThanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.On today's call, we will discuss, among other topics, ONEOK's third quarter financial and operational performance; our financial guidance increase included with yesterday's earnings announcement; NGL fractionation capacity; and we'll share our progress on our now $6 billion in capital growth program. Our strategy to create value for our stakeholder remains the same with our assets well positioned. In some of the most economic and prolific basins in the United States, we continually find opportunities to serve our customers through long-term fee-based contracts. The NGL and natural gas volume growth we have experienced this year continues to result in high-quality earnings growth attributable to our core business of fee-based services. Our volumes in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, combined with favorable optimization and marketing activities from our extensive, reliable and integrated NGL network, has resulted in another increase in our 2018 financial guidance.Since our last call, we've announced additional capital growth projects anchored by long-term customer commitments, which include the second expansion of our West Texas LPG pipeline to serve the continued growth in the Permian; another NGL fractionator in the Gulf Coast, MB-5; another processing plant in the Williston Basin, Demicks Lake II; and an expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline, which has already begun construction. Building off our extensive asset base allows ONEOK to expand at attractive returns, providing clear visibility to strong earnings growth in 2019 and accelerating thereafter.With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt.Walter HulseThank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter operating income totaled $495 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and an 11% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $650 million, a 26% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2018 financial guidance for the second time this year, driven by strong financial and volume performance year-to-date and our confidence in the fourth quarter. We increased guidance for net income by 9%, distributable cash flow by 7% and adjusted EBITDA by 5%, all compared with our previous guidance midpoints.Our new adjusted EBITDA midpoint is now $2.47 billion, an increase of $120 million compared with the guidance we announced last quarter and nearly $500 million above our 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for all three business segments also increased with the largest increase of nearly 11% in the natural gas liquids segment. Continued volume growth and strong optimization results drove the $145 million increase in the NGL segment's guidance.And greater-than-expected volume growth and higher average fee rates drove the guidance increase in the gathering and processing segment. With two months left in 2018, we feel confident in our new financial and volume guidance ranges. Kevin will provide additional detail on our revised 2018 volume expectations.During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.825 per share and last week, we announced another 4% increase to $0.855 per share or $3.42 per share on an annualized basis, in line with our previous guidance. The dividend is payable on November 14 to shareholders of record on November 5. At September 30, our debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.4x and 3.78x on a trailing 12-month basis.We generated $133 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the third quarter, a 6% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. For 2018, we expect to generate more than $500 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends that we can reinvest in the business to fund our capital growth program. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $470 million, up 4% from the previous quarter with a healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4x.",

But before discussing Q3, let me just point out that the GAAP income statement was impacted by one-time net charge totaling $6.9 billion related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is clearly a onetime event, so for use of comparison, we have excluded it from our non-GAAP calculation.Now back to the quarter. Total cloud and software revenue were $8 billion, up 7% and up 3% in constant currency. Inside of cloud and software revenue, GAAP total revenue for application, which is new licenses, license updates including support and SaaS were $2.7 billion, up 9% or 6% in constant currency and GAAP total revenues for platform and infrastructure, which is new licenses, license update, including support and PaaS and IaaS were $5.3 billion, up 8% or 3% in constant currency.Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 21% on a GAAP basis from last year in constant currency with -- on non GAAP basis with Fusion Cloud revenues up 52% in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues for the quarter were $416 million, up 24% from last year in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue, excluding legacy posting services, saw growth of 49% in constant currency and 56% in U.S dollars. As legacy hosting services become smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next generation IaaS will be more visible.As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale in grow and the gross margin has expanded to 67%, up from 65% last Q3. We expect to see further improvement and remain committed to our goal of 80% PaaS gross margin. Now the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 35%, down from last year. However, in looking ahead, I believe we’re at the point where PaaS and IaaS gross margins will begin to improve with Q4 slightly higher than Q3.Total new license and less license updates, including support revenues were $6.4 billion, up 4% in USD with software updates and support revenue of over $5 billion for the first time ever, reflecting continued excellent renewal rate and the strength of our installed base of customers. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.8 billion, up 1% from last year in constant currency and up 5% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 4% from last year in constant currency 9% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 43% last year. There were a couple of the one-time in and out in the expenses impacting this but basically the operating margin has now increased year-over-year for sixth consecutive quarters. And while I can’t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margin will continue to expand.The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was materially lower than guidance at 16.1%, reflecting the impact from the new tax law, as well as other one-time benefits. The GAAP tax rate was 222%, reflecting the $6.9 billion tax charge related to the new tax law. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 20% in USD and up 15% in CD. The GAAP loss per share was $0.98, driven by the one-time charges related to the new tax law. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $15.2 billion, up 13% in U.S dollars and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.3 billion also up 13% in U.S. dollars.",

My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations and joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; Preston Feight, Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley Senior Vice President and Controller.As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic, and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. A summary of risks and uncertainties is described in more detail in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.Ron ArmstrongGood morning. Harrie Schippers, Preston Feight, and I will update you on our excellent third quarter results. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.8 billion and third quarter net income was $545 million, a strong 9.5% after tax return on revenue. Revenues were 14% higher and net income was 35% higher within the third quarter last year.PACCAR's Truck Division's produced a record number of trucks in the third quarter and PACCAR Parts achieved 14% revenue growth compared to the third quarter last year. I am extremely proud of our 28,000 employees who have delivered the world's highest quality Trucks, Parts, and Financial Services to our customers worldwide.PACCAR delivered 47,800 trucks during the third quarter, 3% higher than the second quarter. Increased build rates in North America were partially offset by fewer build days in Europe due to DAF's regular summer shutdown.Truck and Parts' gross margins were 14.1% in the third quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization comparable to the second quarter at about 3%. Costs were impacted by parts shortages from a small number of North American suppliers, including a few affected by Hurricane, Florence. As a result of these part shortages, we incurred additional material and labor costs.Our Tier 1 suppliers are investing in additional capacity and working closely with Tier 2 suppliers to meet PACCAR factory delivery requirements. We expect this situation to normalize in the near term.Our Peterbilt and Kenworth teams in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico did a fantastic job of managing record third quarter production and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry.In the fourth quarter, we're expecting 4% to 8% higher deliveries compared to the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of production days in Europe and higher daily build rates. Truck and Parts gross margins are estimated to be higher in the fourth quarter at around 14.5%. Preston Feight will now provide an update on DAF, PACCAR Parts, and PACCAR Financial Services.Preston FeightThanks Ron. Our 2018 forecast is for Europe's greater than 16 tonne market to be in the range of 310,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting continued strong demand in growing European economies. We expect 2019 to be another excellent year with the market in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. The eurozone's GDP growth expectation for this year is 2% with 2019 projected at a similar level. Freight transport activity on German highways is at record levels up 3.5% this year.DAF has had an incredible year in 2018. DAF XF and CF trucks which were honored as international truck of the year 2018 achieved European above 16 tonne market share of 16.6% year-to-date compared to 15.1% in the same period last year. DAF is making great progress towards its goal of 20% share.PACCAR's Parts business generated strong quarterly revenues of $960 million, 14% higher than the same period last year. Parts quarterly pretax income was $189 million, 24% higher than last year. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer focus technologies drove these results.We are pleased to have opened our new 160,000 square foot parts distribution center in Toronto this month. We expect part sales to grow an additional 5% to 8% next year.PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income increased 12% to $79 million compared to $71 million a year ago. The portfolio which was a record $14.1 billion this quarter continued to perform well.Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 used truck values increased more than 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles.",
                 'PKG': "Thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2018 Earning Results Conference Call.Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.Mark W. Kowlzan - Packaging Corp. of AmericaI'll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then I'm going to turn it over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions.Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $207 million, or $2.18 per share. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.05 per share, primarily for certain costs related to discontinuing paper operations associated with the previously announced conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard.Excluding special items, third quarter 2018 net income was $211 million, or $2.23 per share, compared to third quarter 2017 net income of $159 million or $1.68 per share.Third quarter net sales were $1.8 billion in 2018 and $1.6 billion in 2017. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding special items, was $406 million in 2018 and $364 million in 2017.Excluding the special items, third quarter 2018 earnings per share of $2.23 was $0.55 per share above the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher prices in mix of $0.38, and volumes $0.37 in the Packaging segment; higher prices in mix in our Paper segment of $0.13; lower fiber costs $0.04, which was a combination of improved fiber usage and lower OCC prices; and a favorable tax rate of $0.26, primarily resulting from Tax Reform changes.These items were partially offset by lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.14, higher operating cost totaling $0.28 per share, and converting costs $0.02. These higher costs were primarily due to inflation-related increases with labor and benefits expenses, repair and material costs, environmental and other professional service costs, equipment and building rental costs, as well as the addition of converting costs related to our Sacramento Container acquisition.We also had higher freight and logistics expenses of $0.08 per share; annual outage expenses of $0.05; as well as higher depreciation $0.03; and other costs $0.03 per share. Our results were $0.09 above the third quarter guidance of $2.14 per share, primarily due to higher prices in mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, and higher volumes in our Paper segment.Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter 2018 of $378 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 25% versus last year's EBITDA of $343 million and sales of $1.3 billion or a 25% margin.We achieved all-time record containerboard shipments and record third quarter box shipments. Our containerboard mills operated very well, and we successfully executed the scheduled maintenance outage at the Valdosta mill. The newly converted No. 3 machine at our Wallula mill to high performance 100% virgin kraft linerboard continued to meet or exceed expectations throughout the quarter. This now puts us in position to begin optimizing our entire containerboard system platform and improve our manufacturing and freight costs going forward. Also, just as importantly, this allows us to respond quickly and efficiently to future growth and servicing our customers' needs in a timely manner.We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories about 50,000 tons above the second quarter of 2018 levels and almost 84,000 tons above the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the addition of the inventory needs of our Sacramento Container acquisition, along with our need to build inventory in certain regions of the country to help mitigate the higher freight and logistics issues that we continue to face.In addition, higher inventory levels were required to prepare for the fourth quarter extended outage at the Wallula mill to complete the containerboard conversion work that we've spoken about previously as well as preparing for the first quarter 2019 scheduled maintenance outages at our two largest containerboard mills that will significantly reduce our production early next year.I'm now going to turn it over to Tom who'll provide more details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business.",
                 'PH': "I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Suever, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ma'am, you may begin.Catherine A. Suever - Parker-Hannifin Corp.Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, and welcome to Parker-Hannifin's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Teleconference. Joining me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks.Today's presentation slides, together with the audio webcast replay, will be accessible on the company's investor information website at phstock.com for one year following today's call.On slide number 2, you'll find the company's Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's press release and are also posted on Parker's website at phstock.com.Today's agenda appears on slide number 3. To begin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, will provide highlights for the third quarter. Following Tom's comments, I'll provide a review of the company's third quarter performance, together with the guidance for the full year fiscal 2018. Tom will then provide a few summary comments, and we'll open the call for a question-and-answer session.Please refer now to slide number 4, as Tom will get us started with the highlights.Thomas L. Williams - Parker-Hannifin Corp.So thanks, Cathy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for your participation today. We really appreciate your interest in Parker. So the combination of the Win Strategy, the CLARCOR integration and the strong growth that we saw in the quarter put some very, very nice results for the quarter. Thank you to the Parker team members around the world for all your hard work and dedication and the great progress that we're making.So let's jump into the quarter, starting first with safety. So our injuries were down 25%, and this is driven primarily because of our engagement initiatives, specifically the high-performance teams.Regarding high-performance teams, this initiative has got about 80% of our people across the company are high-performance teams, about 5,000 teams worldwide. Remember the goal here is to create an ownership culture, and that idea of ownership starts with safety. And the kind of progress we've seen on safety, we expect to translate to the progress we want as we create ownership around quality, cost and delivery.We hit a number of all-time records in the quarter as reported. And just a reminder, when I say all-time records, this means in the history of Parker. So we had sales of $3.75 billion for the quarter, net income of $366 million, net income ROS of 9.8% and EPS of $2.70.We had a third quarter record for segment operating margins of 15.8% as reported. This is especially noteworthy, given the amount of depreciation and amortization we have in CLARCOR, the restructuring, the CLARCOR costs to achieve and all the activities that happened in the quarter, to still put up an all-time record for Q3 is very impressive.Other highlights for the quarter, sales increased 20%. It was 8% organic, which is approximately 2 times the growth rate for global industrial production. We had order entry rates increase 11%. This marks the third quarter in a row of double-digit order entry. Adjusted segment operating margins were 16.3%, and EBITDA margins were up 280 basis points to 17.1% as reported or 17.6% adjusted. Adjusted EPS was $2.80, increasing 33% versus the prior year.So let me switch to cash and capital deployment. As you've heard me say before, our goal is to be great generators and deployers of cash. And our priorities are, in this order; first, dividends. And last week, we were very excited to announce our 15% dividend increase, very positive for our shareholders. This marks the 62nd consecutive year of increase in annual dividends paid. It's a track record we're very proud of and a track record we have – it remains to continue with. (04:28)Organic growth investment, which is the most efficient investment we can make on behalf of shareholders, and we've done a great job paying down debt. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA multiples, if you start when we did the CLARCOR close, it was at 3.6 tines. And at the Q3 close, we're at 2.6 times. So, very significant progress on debt reduction, really tied to the fact that we've driven significant improvements in generating EBITDA.We're going to continue our 10b5-1 share repurchase program. And as our debt reduces, we're going to reevaluate acquisitions and discretionary share repurchase and, as always, try to make the best decisions we can on behalf of our shareholders.",
                 'PAYX': " Now I’ll turn the meeting over to your host Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may now begin.Martin MucciThank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2018. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately one month. On today’s call, I will review business highlights for the third quarter and Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we’ll open it up to any questions. We were pleased with our results for the third quarter as we continued to deliver solid performance across our major HCM product lines. Our total revenue growth was 9% aided by our acquisition of HROI, this is the highest revenue growth in our past six fiscal quarters. In addition, to HROI organic HR into our outsourcing services, retirement services and insurance services all performed very well in the quarter. And March 1, 2018, we announced the acquisition of lesser group and market leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in Northern Europe. We believe the combination of Lessor’s payroll and HCM software products with our full service business process outsourcing capabilities will provide a complete technology-enabled services platform in the markets that they serve and we’ll expand too. The Lessor’s group is a good strategic fit for the following reasons. First, the vast majority of which clients across four countries don our target small business market. Lessor has a solid and scalable proprietary intellectual property with experience technology development talent. They have a season management team, they are profitable and reflect study growth with the ability to fund further growth and development. We can leverage Lessor to support our growth in Germany, where we’ve been for the past 10 years and provide an enhanced technology solution going forward there. And this acquisition offers us the opportunity to expand our market penetration in countries Lessor serves as well as other European countries in the future. We are pleased to welcome the employees of Lesser Group to the Paychex’s family and while our international operations are currently small in relation to the company as a whole, we are excited by the opportunities this acquisition provides us for further expansion and growth. We have seen increased momentum in our sales execution as the year has progressed, in third quarter sales to new businesses were up approximately 7% compared to last year's third quarter. During our third quarter selling season in the small into the market less than ten employees, our sales teams have done very well. The mid-market up 20 plus to 500 or so, has seen an increase in the competitive intensity. However, our comprehensive HR Outsourcing services both PEO and ASO which we consider part of the mid-market performed well in both sales and client retention. HROI acquired in August has been tracking ahead of our plan. Overall despite a slow start to the year we have exited our selling season with momentum. The labor market show signs of tightening as evidenced by our Paychex’s IHS, market small business employment watch, the growth in jobs is stabilizing because of challenges in finding qualified employees and we expect this will result in business owners making positive changes to wages and benefits as they compete for top talent. We've seen a 12-month growth in hourly earnings of about 2.7%. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector. We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market.On December 21, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform was enacted and it’s the most comprehensive tax reform legislation in more than two decades. Paychex is a corporate taxpayer, it’s a significant beneficiary of tax reform. Efrain will discuss the financial impacts in more detail, however, I want to mention that as a result of the significant income tax reduction, we plan to utilize some of this opportunistic benefit to make various investments in our business. These investments include accelerating certain technology projects for the continued evolution of our customer experience, increasing our spend in marketing demand generation and sales and service strategy enhancement as well as investment in our employees. These accelerated investments will help drive future returns for our shareholders. As it pertains to our clients, we are already helping them navigate the new tax code. Our systems were updated with the new tax rates within hours of their release and we provide many resources to our clients from online educational content to our dedicated service center with experienced payrolls specialists and onsite HR support. We are committed to delivering best in class technology solutions for our clients and business partners and our HCM solutions have continued to gain acceptance as shown by recent recognition we have received and I'd like to mention a few of those. We were recognized as a leader in the 2018 NelsonHall Evaluation and Assessment Tool or NEAT for payroll services for the second year in a row. We received this recognition for the overall depth of the payroll delivery capability and a robust user experience which is enabled through our Paychex Flex cloud platform. In addition to this overall distinction, we also were placed in the leader quadrant for technology and user experience, analytics and reporting and our HR cloud integration. We are proud that our Flex platform has once again been recognized as an innovative and powerful tool that enables our clients to gain productivity and focus and growing their businesses.",
                 'PYPL': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Gabrielle RabinovitchThank you, Sheri.

All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 18, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.Dan SchulmanThank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. PayPal had another excellent quarter with $3.68 billion of revenue growing at 14% on both, the spot and currency neutral basis. Normalizing through the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony revenues grew at 21%. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.4% grew 142 basis points from last year, and we delivered $0.58 of non-GAAP EPS, up 26% year-over-year. In short, we continue to drive strong financial performance.As pleased as I am with our financials, the highlight of the quarter was our growth in net new actives and engagement. We drove a record 9.1 million net new active accounts surpassing 254 million customer accounts by the end of the quarter. We added 34 million net new actives to our platform in the past 12 months, averaging almost 3 million net new customers per month. During the quarter we drove 2.5 billion transactions growing 27%. Our engagement per active user increased 9.5% to 36.5x per year. A major driver of engagement is the use of mobile devices across our platform. Predominantly driven by our market leading checkout conversion rates with One Touch. One Touch continues to expand with 112 million consumers and 10.4 million merchants using One Touch. In Q3, we saw mobile growth of 45% with approximately 57 billion of mobile volume processed in the quarter. Mobile checkout now represents 40% of our total payment volume.Customer choice also continues to yield a meaningful lift in our engagement metrics. Today, nearly all of our customers have choice available to them, and more than 55 million PayPal customers have actively used choice in some 200 markets. Another very important outcome of choice was that it enabled PayPal to develop deep partnerships throughout our ecosystem. In just over two years we've signed over 35 partnerships with some of the world's largest and most influential brands in finance, in technology and commerce. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we've signed a multi-faceted partnership agreement with American Express. As one of the leading brands in the world it always made sense that PayPal and American Express would become strategic partners. Steve Squeri and his team have been great to work with, and I'm very pleased with the comprehensive nature of our partnership going forward.Over the next several quarters PayPal will have enhanced access to American Express as a payment option in our wallet. The agreement will allow PayPal to access American Express tokens and enables a deep integration of our Venmo and PayPal P2P capabilities within the Amex platform.Additionally, PayPal and American Express consumers will be able to use their American Express reward points to pay for their purchases at millions of PayPal merchants around the world. Over the next year we will rollout these capabilities to our mutual customers and we are pleased to begin what will be an important relationship for both companies. With this agreement we now have strategic relationships in place with all of the major card networks, not only have these partnerships redefined our competitive landscape, they have also created new and unique commerce experiences for our mutual customers around the world.",
                 'PNR': 'Jim LucasThanks, Crystal and welcome to Pentair’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We are glad you could join us today.

I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.I will now turn the call over to John.John StauchThank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 titled Executive Summary. We are pleased with our third quarter as we were able to deliver results in line or better than our forecast on all of our key metrics marked by 6% core sales growth, 10% adjusted EPS growth and over $100 million of free cash flow generated in the quarter and $265 million year-to-date. All three segments contributed to the top line performance with Aquatic Systems delivering a strong 12% core sales growth in the quarter. We also used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to buyback 100 million of shares in the quarter and have purchased 400 million to the first three quarters.For the full year, we raised our core sales growth expectation by a full point to be 4% to 5% and we are still expecting ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18%. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be approximately $2.33, which reflects the third quarter performance as well as the small benefit from share repurchases in the quarter. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our expectations driven in part by continued healthy end markets as well as continued execution across our portfolio.I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the third quarter results and update you on the details of our full year 2018 outlook before I provide an update on our key strategic growth initiatives.Mark BorinThank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3 ‘18 Pentair performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 6%. All three segments contributed this quarter with particular strength in Aquatic Systems. We will provide more color on the performance of all three segments shortly. Segment income increased 1%, while ROS contracted 40 basis points to 17.1% in line with expectations as price increases implemented to offset inflation took effect late in the quarter. We will expand on the margin performance when discussing the individual segments.Adjusted EPS grew 10% to $0.54 per share, which was $0.02 ahead of our prior guidance. Our adjusted tax rate remained 18% and our share count came in at 175.7 million shares benefiting in part from the 150 million in shares we repurchased during the second quarter and an additional 100 million we repurchased during the third quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $108 million and we have generated $265 million in free cash flow year-to-date, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns.Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 ‘18 Pentair segment performance. This slide lays out the performance of our three segments. Aquatic Systems delivered a strongest performance of the year with 12% core sales growth in the quarter, income growth of 13% and ROS expansion of 60 basis points. We saw strong demand in the quarter, favorable mix and continued dealer gains. In addition, we implemented our annual price increase in September, while continuing to increase our growth investments in this important segment. We believe the outlook for Aquatic Systems remains very favorable and we continue to believe in the long-term outlook of our franchise business.',

Net income of $117 million was up 29% year-over-year, while earnings per common share of $0.33 increased $0.07.These results benefited from higher revenues, well controlled expenses, sustained exceptional asset quality and the lower effective tax rate. Total revenues increased 7% from a year ago and 1% compared to the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher net interest income, reflecting continued net interest margin expansion. The margin improved 11 basis points year-over-year as well as 5 basis points linked quarter and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continued to outpace the rise in deposit costs.As expected, deposits rebounded in the third quarter with average balances growing $522 million or 2% from the second quarter. While our deposit costs were up 11 basis points for the quarter, we continued to focus on controlling pricing, as demonstrated by an interest bearing deposit beta of 24% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. As we stated last quarter, we remain competitive gathering deposits in order to protect market share and client relationships, however, we will remain disciplined and not lead the market in crisis.Moving on to loans, average balances were flat compared to the second quarter, while the period end balances were down $313 million or 1%. The decrease in the period end loans is attributable to a $201 million decline in mortgage warehouse lending balances, and a run-off of $128 million in the transactional portion of the New York multi-family portfolio. Year-to-date, loan growth has been below our expectations, primarily due to heightened competition, driven by both bank and non-bank lenders, lower demands and above average payoffs. Looking forward, acknowledging the impact of these headwinds, particularly in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as the industry wide slowdown in the home equity market, we will not reach our 2018 loan growth goal of 3% to 5% at year and. However, it is important to note that this shortfall in loan growth does not impact our original full year earnings expectations, as we are tracking in line with our other disclosed full year goals.Additionally, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. Pipelines at the end of the third quarter are at solid levels and we expect continuation of positive results across many of our businesses that have performed well this year, including equipment financing and middle market C&I. We're very pleased with the performance of lease, as it continues to drive excellent growth at yields that are meaningfully higher than the rest of our total portfolio.The addition [indiscernible] to this business at the end of the second quarter has also enhanced these already strong results. In this environment, we continue to emphasize the importance of improving operating leverage, as evidenced by a third quarter efficiency ratio of 56.7%, an improvement of 170 basis points on a linked quarter basis. We remain focused on growing net interest income and non-interest income as well as tightly managing expenses.We are particularly pleased with our ability to control costs, especially as we further invest in revenue producing talent and enhance technology. As the financial needs of our clients evolve, they require bankers who understand their complex challenges and serve as advisors to help them achieve sustainable growth. As such, we recently bolstered our commercial banking capabilities with the establishment of three verticals, franchise finance, technology and not-for-profit and we concurrently hired three Boston based senior bankers to lead each vertical.We are pleased to have these leaders join People's United, as their in-depth industry knowledge and expertise will deepen our current relationships and attract new ones. In addition to investing in revenue producing talent, we continue to make investments to enhance our technological capabilities. Given that the consumer shift to digital channel is evident, we have been tactically driving various digital initiatives and building a foundation to address opportunities.",
                 'PEP': "It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.Jamie CaulfieldThank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s CFO. We'll lead off today’s call with a review of our third quarter performance and full year 2018 outlook and then we'll move on to Q&A.Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information.Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today’s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.When discussing our financial results on today’s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning’s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo’s website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.Indra NooyiThank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. As most of you know, we announced in August that I'm stepping down as CEO of PepsiCo after 12 years in the role effective tomorrow. And so today will be my final conference call with you. Actually my 75th and final, if you also include the calls I've participated in as CFO.After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results and outlook and taking your questions. I'd like to ask for your patience and allow me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call.So, moving on to business; for the quarter we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter.The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequential acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters. The majority of our businesses again perform well, but particularly strong performances by our international sectors and solid performance by Frito-Lay in North America.And while North American beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price realization.Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization driving by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, in June we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites inspired by French Cheese Puff, these bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside creating a sophisticated snacking experience.In fact cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good source of calcium and have six grams of protein per serving, and they come in a resealable pouch making them great for a convenient on-the-go experience.Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on accelerating experiences. The program highlighted the brands recent innovations, Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice and rewarded consumers to purchase both products with merchandise and experiences.The eight-week media campaigns supporting the program span social media channels that are also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers' distinctive music. Tostitos' growth was fueled by new products such as Roasted Red Pepper and Black Bean and Garlic.To support the product launches we created the program to drive trial during the summer get-togethers. Our Buy, Ride, Get Together already program allowed consumers to scan a code of specially marked bags to redeem a $5 lift credit making it even easier for our consumers to get safety to and from summer parties. And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos Flaming Hot Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers growing desire for intense flavors.Cheetos further benefited from our Cheetos Museum Win What You See campaign, with our first-ever Cheetos promotion supported by TV commercials directing consumers to winwhatyousee.com where we invited our fans to find and submit unique Cheetos shapes to have a chance to win what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions and the program is now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and counting.",
                 'PKI': "Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jamey Mock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 14, 2018.Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that PerkinElmer had another strong quarter, delivering revenue growth of 22% on a reported basis and core organic revenue growth of 7% with each of our core businesses growing organically 7%.Including the impact of EUROIMMUN, our Diagnostics business grew organically 8% as EUROIMMUN once again grew double digits. While our organic growth exceeded our guidance, total adjusted dollar revenue of $675 million only equaled our guidance as changes in foreign currency rates relative to the dollar since the end of last quarter reduced revenue by approximately 2% or $10 million.We're also pleased with our adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter, which increased 23% over Q2 last year to $0.90 per share. This was $0.02 lower than our original guidance as the incremental income from the greater organic growth was more than offset by the negative impact of the foreign exchange movements previously mentioned as well as higher long-term compensation costs caused mostly by the strong growth of our stock price during the third quarter.If we adjusted for the impact of these two unforecasted items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.97 which would have beat our guidance by $0.05. While Jamey will discuss our financial results in more detail, we continue to be very pleased with both the breadth and level of organic growth as well as with our significant adjusted EPS growth.As has been the case all the year, our strong top line organic growth is attributable to both favorable end market conditions and the benefits of focusing our portfolio on fewer technologies and higher growth end markets where we have differentiated capabilities and excellent customer relationships.During the third quarter, we continued to make minor adjustments to the portfolio as we completed the sale of our multispectral imaging product through Akoya Biosciences, a portfolio company owned by Telegraph Hill Partners. We will continue to partner with Akoya on advanced tissue imaging technology to realize the potential of this technology to benefit immuno-oncology and other areas of disease research and treatments.Also, we recently closed the acquisition of DANI Instruments. Based in Milan, Italy, DANI brings advanced capabilities in gas chromatography to help accelerate our workflow solutions in food, pharma and environmental end markets. We also continue to add access to a broader suite of potentially disruptive technologies and capabilities through our ongoing investments in smart technology companies and licensing efforts.While both our organic and inorganic investments over the last couple years have been largely focused on increasing our growth profile, these moves have also resulted in our portfolio of technologies that are increasingly more synergistic and capable. It is clear to us that technologies, applications and customer needs are converging across DAS and Diagnostics as our customers' businesses evolve an alliance between therapeutics, diagnostics, food and digital health are intersecting.As we continue to both add and focus our capabilities, the opportunities across PerkinElmer expand, allowing DAS to become an enabler of the sciences of diagnostics and vice versa. Creating a culture and organizational nimbleness to facilitate this as seamlessly as possible and respond quickly to these opportunities will provide, in our view, another lever to further support our customers and enable incremental growth.To that end, we recently brought together our top 175 scientists, engineers and product managers with a particular emphasis on our new acquisitions to discuss opportunities to accelerate collaboration around several key areas including assay development, genomics, automated workflows and digital solutions. To give a sense of these opportunities, we see the ability to more comprehensively pull together our immunoassay development capabilities across the company, including our life science lyse reagents, our EUROIMMUN antibody and antigen development expertise, our automated newborn screening assay platforms and our lateral flow technologies from both Bioo Scientific and our Tulip immunodiagnostic business in India.",
                 'PRGO': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. PlcThank you. Good morning, everyone, welcome to Perrigo's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. Copies of the release are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining today's call are Murray Kessler, Perrigo's new President and CEO; and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's CFO.I'd like to remind everyone that during the call, participants may make certain forward-looking statement. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we've provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.Turning to the agenda on slide 3. First, Ron will share our third quarter performance results and discuss each of the segments in detail. Ron will then review our balance sheet highlights and the company's updated 2018 guidance. Our new President and CEO, Murray Kessler, with then share his initial thoughts on his first month at Perrigo and lay out his priorities before opening the call for questions.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. PlcThanks, Brad; and good morning, everyone. We are excited to have Murray Kessler, our recently appointed President and CEO, on the call this morning. Murray joins us with a wealth of experience, having run two public companies prior to Perrigo, as I will outline in more detail later in my remarks.Before I discuss the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to open with a few remarks on the business. Even though our total adjusted EPS results were above our expectations, the quarter benefited from a onetime tax savings of approximately $0.06 per share. In total, our Consumer businesses adjusted operating income was in line with our expectation. However, the RX segment continued to underperform. The key driver behind the lower 2018 guidance provided today is due primarily to RX, as we continue to experience weakness within this business and anticipate lower new product sales for this segment.To put this in perspective, when starting the year, our consolidated adjusted operating income guidance was approximately $1.06 billion at the midpoint. Our expectation today, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, is approximately $905 million at the midpoint, or $155 million below our original guidance. This change in adjusted operating income can be attributed to RX underperforming against our original plan. This is obviously disappointing.Now, turning to our third quarter operational highlight. I would like to begin by highlighting things that continue to gain momentum in the business. First, excluding animal health, our Consumer businesses grew on an organic constant currency basis by approximately 2%, led by CHC Americas, which grew approximately 3% in the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year.Second, within the CHC International segment, adjusted operating margin increased 230 basis points compared to the prior year to approximately 19% and has achieved an adjusted operating margin of approximately 17% year-to-date. Third, RX team continued to drive our extended topicals strategy, with continued investment in our pipeline evidenced by higher R&D spend, representing approximately 11% of net sales in the quarter.Finally, our platform, once again, delivered consistent cash flow. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was slightly under 100% for the quarter. And we utilized our free cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility to repurchase approximately $135 million worth of our shares during the quarter.Now, I will discuss areas that need immediate attention and what we are doing to correct them. First, as I said, the RX business was a primary driver of our shortfall in adjusted operating income for the quarter and the full-year projection. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we have appointed new leadership. Sharon Kochan was appointed President of the RX business. Sharon is an experienced operator, who was instrumental in building the Perrigo RX segment from its infancy and is the right executive to lead the previously announced separation.Second, our animal health business in the CHC Americas segment continues to underperform. We are taking a close look at the core capabilities of this business and its respective position in the animal health industry.Third, we have identified various operating inefficiencies, which have impacted gross profit and our ability to achieve customer service expectations in both our U.S. Consumer and RX (Prescription) businesses. The factors leading to these inefficiencies include the culmination of: One, rising input cost; two, lower productivity due primarily to a tight labor market; and three, competing priorities.",
                 'PFE': "Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Charles E. Triano - Pfizer Inc.The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our website, pfizer.com/investors. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the Disclosure Notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2017 annual report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the original date of this call. And we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.During our call, we will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Form 8-K dated today, October 30, 2018.Any non-GAAP measures presented are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP, have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies.Ian, Albert, and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?Ian C. Read - Pfizer Inc.Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making within each of our businesses and the latest advancements within our R&D pipeline. I will then ask Albert to discuss some of the steps we are taking to prepare the company to accelerate top line growth in the future.In the third quarter, total company revenues were up 2% operationally, driven by a continued strength of key brands, biosimilars, and emerging markets. These growth drivers were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a decline in U.S. Legacy Established Products, driven by industry-wide pricing challenges, as well as product supply shortages and associated inventory reduction related to our legacy Hospira products.I'll begin with a few words about each of our businesses, starting with Pfizer Innovative Health. This business had another solid quarter, growing its top line 5% operationally, thanks to the continued strength of several of our biggest selling medicines.We remain very pleased with the performance of Ibrance, which has solidified its leadership position in the CDK 4/6 inhibitor class in the U.S., holding at just under a 90% share in terms of new prescription volume. Our current growth driver for Ibrance remains the international markets, particularly across Europe and Japan. And we had another quarter of solid growth there.For Xtandi, alliance revenues in the U.S. were up 5% over the second quarter and a 20% year-over-year growth. We are seeing an increased number of urologists prescribing it.There are positive early indicators with our PROSPER launch in the U.S. following the July approval, which made Xtandi the first and only FDA approved oral medication for both nonmetastatic and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.And the European Commission has very recently approved Xtandi for the treatment of adult men with high risk nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, based on the PROSPER study data.Eliquis continues to perform well. Pfizer's revenues for Eliquis were up 36% operationally to nearly $900 million. And it continues to maintain a strong leadership position in the NOAC class. Eliquis also overtook wore Warfarin to become the number one in OAC total brand, total prescription share in the U.S.Xeljanz also continues to perform well with revenue up 26% operationally. This was bolstered by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis revenues and some early contributions from the drug's recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.Xeljanz scripts were up 31% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The main reason for the disconnect this quarter between volume growth and revenue growth in the U.S. market is that higher prescription demand was partially offset by a one-time year-to-date true-up in the quarter for access payments with one customer.Sales of Prevnar 13 were up 12% in the U.S., largely due to the timing of government purchases. Sales were up 14% operationally in the emerging markets, driven by growth in the pediatric business, strong Gavi performance, and the 2017 launch in China.Finally, our Consumer Healthcare business posted strong growth internationally, while U.S. revenues were down slightly due to the LOE impact of Nexium 24HR, we continue to review options and expect a decision regarding strategic alternatives for this business will be made by the end of the calendar year.Turning now to Pfizer Essential Health. We once again saw strong operational growth in emerging markets and in biosimilars. Overall, Essential Health revenues for the quarter declined, however, due in large part to the ongoing product supply shortages in the sterile injectable business, continuing product LOEs, namely Lyrica in developed Europe, and a decline in the Legacy Established Products portfolio in developed markets.Emerging markets revenue within the Essential Health business grew 11% operationally for the quarter, primarily reflecting growth across the Legacy Established Products and sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio in China.",
                 'PM': "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.Nick RolliWelcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App.A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.Additionally, following the comprehensive business review that we provided at our recent Investor Day, today we will summarize our 2018 full-year outlook and third quarter results, as well as our performance in select geographies. For reference, the slides and transcripts for the Investor Day presentations are available on our website and our IR App.It's now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?Martin KingThank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2018 reported diluted earnings per share guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be in a range of $4.97 to $5.02.Our guidance includes $0.12 of unfavorable currency and represents a growth rate, excluding currency of approximately 8% to 9% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. Our guidance continues to reflect the full-year assumptions shown on this slide and detailed in today's press release.Importantly, this includes: PMI heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 41 billion to 42 billion units, reflecting a net anticipated distributor inventory reduction of approximately 3 billion units; and PMI heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume of 44 billion to 45 billion units.Moving to our third quarter results, total shipment volume decreased by 2.1%, due mainly to the impact of distributor inventory movements, notably related to heated tobacco units in Japan. Excluding inventory movements, total shipment volume increased by 1.1%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume in the EU, Japan, Korea, the Middle East and Africa region and Russia as well as higher cigarette volume in select markets, notably Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.September year-to-date, total shipment volume declined by 1.2%, but increased by 0.3% excluding inventory movements.Given the impact of distributor heated tobacco unit inventory movements on our third quarter 2018 results, let me take a moment to put this into perspective vis-à-vis the 3 billion unit full-year distributor inventory reduction assumption that we previously communicated.As seen on this chart, the full-year reduction is driven by Japan and concentrated in the third quarter, with a decrease of 3.7 billion units. By comparison, there was an inventory increase in the third quarter of 2017 of 3.2 billion units, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.9 billion units.For the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate a 0.5 billion unit inventory increase. This compares to an inventory increase of 7.3 billion units in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.8 billion units.Importantly, heated tobacco unit inventories have been right-sized, and we are poised for future growth.Third quarter net revenues increased by 3.3%, excluding currency, driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by the impact of the heated tobacco unit inventory adjustment that I just noted, as well as unfavorable combustible tobacco volume/mix.Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter came in slightly above the approximately 2% growth expectation that we provided during Investor Day. As this difference mainly reflects timing between the third and fourth quarters, we are maintaining our full-year net revenue growth assumption of approximately 3%, excluding currency.Given our September year-to-date growth of 6.5%, this implies a decline in the fourth quarter of approximately 5%, largely reflecting the difficult comparison with the nearly 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.Adjusted operating income increased by 7.6%, excluding currency, reflecting the price-driven growth in net revenues, the favorable margin impact of lower IQOS device sales, as well as lower manufacturing and marketing costs for combustible products, partly offset by incremental RRP investments across IQOS launch markets.Adjusted operating income margin increased by 1.8 points, excluding currency.Our reported diluted EPS of $1.44 increased by 13.4% in the quarter, driven by favorable business performance, and also benefiting from the lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense compared to the third quarter of 2017.",
                 'PSX': "I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.Jeff DietertGood morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO.The presentation material we will be using during the call can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 Web site, along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our SEC filings.Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'd like to point out a change in our question-and-answer session. Based on investor feedback on how to improve our call, and to allow everyone the opportunity to ask a question, we are asking that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If you have additional questions we ask you rejoin the queue.With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.Greg GarlandThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, a record $3.10 per share. This quarter, we demonstrated the value of our integrated portfolio attributing strong earnings. In the central corridor, our Refining and Midstream assets ran at record levels, capturing strong margins. We continue to benefit from advantaged feedstocks as the industry's largest purchase of heavy Canadian crude. We achieved record Midstream earnings. And in Marketing, we realized solid margins on refined product sales. We've repurchased or exchanged nearly 30% of our initial shares outstanding over the last six years, contributing to our record adjusted earnings per share this quarter.We continued our commitment to distributions by returning $775 million through dividends and share repurchase in the third quarter and $5.2 billion for the year. Strong shareholder distributions remain fundamental to our disciplined capital allocation approach. We're investing in a robust portfolio of projects with attractive returns to create shareholder value and drive future growth.During the third quarter, Phillips 66 Partners once again achieved record adjusted EBITDA. PSXP has grown at a rapid pace during its first five years. With its scale and financial strength, PSXP is well positioned to fund and sustain a significant organic capital program to drive future EBITDA growth. Phillips 66 Partners is the operator and largest owner in the Grey Oak Pipeline project. Grey Oak will provide crude oil transportation from the Permian and the Eagle Ford to Texas Gulf Coast destinations, including our Sweeny Refinery. Supported by shipper commitments, the capacity of the pipeline will be 900,000 barrels per day, is on schedule to be in service by the end of 2019.At the Sweeny Hub, we're building two 150,000 per day NGL fractionators, and adding 6 million barrels of storage at Phillips 66 Partners Clemens Caverns. We have agreements in place with multiple parties, including DCP Midstream, to supply Y-grade to the new fractionators. The Hub will have 400,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity, and 15 million barrels of storage when the expansion is completed in late 2020. Our Sweeny Hub is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast, and directly accessible from the Permian. Gulf Coast fractionation capacity remains tight, and there's strong interest from customers and future expansion projects.At the Beaumont Terminal, we recently placed 900,000 barrels of fully contracted new crude oil storage into service. We're having additional crude tanks under construction that will increase the terminal's total capacity to 14.6 million barrels by the end of this year. During the third quarter, we had about 200,000 barrels per day of exports across our dock. The continued growth in domestic crude production is expected to result in the need for higher Gulf Coast exports, and we're making investments to capitalize on those opportunities. At Beaumont, we recently approved a new project to further increase crude storage by 2.2 million with completion anticipated in early 2020.PSXP also has a 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal under development in Corpus Christi. The terminal is connected to Grey Oak Pipeline, and will provide 3.4 million barrels of crude storage upon completion in late 2019. DCP Midstream continues to expand the Sand Hills Pipeline to meet the demand for growing NGL production in the Permian Basin. DCP increased the pipeline's capacity to 440,000 barrels per day at the end of the third quarter, and further expansion to 485,000 barrels per day is expected by the end of this year. Sand Hills is owned two-third by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners. In the high-growth DJ Basin, DCP's Mewbourn 3 gas processing plant started up in the third quarter. And the O'Connor 2 plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019.",

Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 15. I will now turn the call over to Don.Don BrandtThank you, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West Board also displayed confidence in the company’s outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I’ll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job, maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined.The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity. To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We’ve received bids on our request for forest, bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We’re in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 timeframe.Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting and the ACC will issue a decision. APS’ installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future.We commissioned the selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions. In August, APS filed their second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second layer savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million.Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid.",
                 'PXD': "Pioneer has prepared PowerPoint slides to supplement their comments today. These slides can be accessed over the internet at www.pxd.com. Again, the internet site to access the slides related to today's call is www.pxd.com. At the web site, select Investors, then select Earnings and Webcasts.This call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be archived on the internet site through December 2, 2018. The company's comments today will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in Pioneer's news release, on page 2 of the slide presentation, and in Pioneer's public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Pioneer's Vice President of Investor Relations, Neal Shah. Please go ahead, sir.Neal H. Shah - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim will be up first. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2018, a strong quarter of execution for Pioneer, and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year.After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin, including our recent successful Stackberry appraisal results.Rich will then update you on our firm transportation commitments to move oil from the Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we are receiving. Rich will also cover the third quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.Tim will then return with a brief recap and general commentary on 2019. After that, we will open up the call for your questions. Thank you.So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim.Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.Thanks a lot, Neal. On any objective measure, the third quarter was an exceptionally strong quarter for Pioneer. We substantially beat consensus on earnings and EBITDA. And cash flow for the quarter exceeded our capital spending, all of which are huge positives for PXD.Earnings were very robust at $355 million on an adjusted basis or $2.07 per diluted share.Total Permian production met the top-end of the range that we had provided for the quarter. And importantly, Permian oil production exceeded the top-end of the range, growing by 7% quarter over quarter.Due to that exceptionally strong execution during the quarter, the number of wells that we put on production exceeded our estimates, where we placed 69 horizontal wells on production. And as a result, the balance sheet remains very strong with significant cash on hand and very low debt statistics. And in fact, net debt was reduced by $200 million this year – this quarter on a quarter-to-quarter basis.Turning to slide 4. The company continues to benefit from its long-term planning approach and particularly regarding our FT program for oil deliveries to the high priced Gulf Coast and export markets. And for the quarter, that benefit resulted in about $200 million of incremental cash flow for the third quarter.The number is expected to come down to about $125 million in the fourth quarter. That's simply a product of the differentials having tightened in the fourth quarter as compared to those numbers in the third quarter.We're still continuing to deliver quite a large volume of oil to the Gulf Coast, about 165,000 BOE a day – or barrels of oil per day in the third quarter under those same FT contracts. And about 130,000 BOPD were exported.Those numbers will be increasing. In fact, our FT capacity goes up beginning of November to 185,000 barrels of oil per day and over 200,000 [BOPD] in early 2019. So this will become an even bigger part of our results as we move forward. And we continue to see the benefits of incremental pricing as a result.One of the things we've then seen is that about 90% of these volumes – over 90% of our volumes will be on FT contracts. And those receive Brent-related pricing, so that's a tremendous positive for the company.And as we discussed on our last call for the second quarter, we have no exposure today for Midland oil pricing through 2020. That kicked in really in September.Similarly on natural gas, the company has benefited greatly from FT to western markets, where we receive an uplift of about $1 per Mcf versus that as if we had left the gas into Waha, into Waha sales areas for the whole third quarter.And from an operational standpoint, Joey will cover this in a lot more detail, but the results look very promising for our first Stackberry pad. You may recall we're drilling a total of three sets of these pads, the first of which we're reporting on today.",
                 'PNC': 'I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.Bryan GillWell, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today’s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC’s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.Today’s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 12, 2018, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.Bill DemchakThanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. This morning, you would have seen PNC reported third quarter net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.82 per diluted common share. Overall, I thought we delivered another really solid quarter, highlighted by continued progress on our strategic priorities and our key financial metrics, all moving in the right direction.We grew average loans and deposits and we continue to add new clients. Net interest income increased, NIM expanded and fee income grew. In fact, we hit a record high for fee income through nine months, with increases in basically every category other than residential mortgage.We continue to manage expenses well with the small increase this quarter reflecting higher business activity. Credit quality also remained strong with nonperformers of net charge-offs down and our tangible book value per share grew again, and we’ve raised the quarterly dividend to $0.95 in August.And I do want to touch on loan growth for a second, because I know it’s something you were all watching closely. While we did see modest growth in the quarter consistent with industry data, our corporate loan growth came in below our own expectations. We attribute the shortfall to a combination of several factors, including elevated competition, meaningfully higher payoffs this quarter and paydowns and overall lower line utilization.The higher payoffs and paydowns appear to be driven by competition from non-bank lenders, excess corporate cash and attractive opportunities for our clients in the bond markets. Interestingly, our secured lending businesses, excluding real estate, which collectively comprised roughly a third of our book and faced less competition, they grew at almost 3% this quarter.Now, while we recognize these challenges, we can impact all of them directly, what we can and are doing is executing upon our Main Street model providing value-added solutions in a world-class service. We continue to add new customers and deepen relationships that meet our risk-adjusted returns.On the consumer side, I was pleased to see loan growth again this quarter. And while our outlook for fourth quarter loan quarter is up modestly as Rob is going to you review with you a bit later. The economy is really strong, consumers are in great financial shape and companies are optimistic and growing. In addition, recent market disruption may help to alleviate some of the challenges that I outlined a moment ago.So, we expect to see continued opportunities for loan growth moving forward. To that end, we are experiencing success in our national initiative to expand our middle market corporate banking franchise and faster growing markets. And we also recently launched our national retail digital strategy, leading with a high-yield savings account and offering our virtual wallet checking accounts, which will be supported by an ultra-thin retail network.In fact, we just opened our first out-of-footprint retail location in Kansas City earlier this week. As we work to expand the reach of our brand, we are excited about how we are positioned to drive growth and efficiency through time. And before I hand it over to Rob, I just want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, as well as our clients for their trust in us.With that, over to you, Rob.Rob ReillyGreat. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you’ve seen by now, we’ve reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.82 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew approximately $700 million linked-quarter and $4.1 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago.Investment securities of $80.8 billion increased $3.3 billion, or 4% linked-quarter. Purchases were primarily agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries.',
                 'RL': "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead.Evren KopelmanGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees. And our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations' website.And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice.Patrice LouvetThank you, Evren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased to report better-than-expected results for the third quarter, as we continue to execute on our key initiatives, especially during the important holiday season. We still have a lot of work to do to return to industry-leading revenue and earnings growth, but these results give us confidence that we are on the right track.If you recall from our last call, we're focused on reigniting growth, while continuing to drive productivity. And it is this balance that will create value for our stakeholders. To do so, we're executing against four key initiatives: first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product; second, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility.Let me take you through the progress we made across each in the third quarter, starting with our first key initiative, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product.In the third quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail. AUR was up 4% across the company's direct-to-consumer network similar to the first half of the year. Our North America holiday sales were ahead of plans, even with reduced promotions versus last year. Importantly, this was achieved in the context of a marketplace with high levels of promotional activity.We continue to improve the quality of our distribution, by closing unproductive doors and reducing off-price penetration within wholesale. This contributed to 250 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin, building on our gains from the first half of the year.We're also making progress in improving quality of product as we reallocate more of a production volume to a network of factories that consistently deliver superior quality.Moving on to our second key initiative, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within products our strategy has the following five key elements: driving a much more disciplined assortment; focus on our icons, renew our core items to create more appeal with today's consumer; develop interest with newness and innovation including limited editions; capsule collections and personalization to inject energy and excitement into our brand; and finally, drive under-developed categories that have high potential.I want to share a few ways we're progressing across these elements from the third quarter. Starting with assortment discipline, this season had a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs, as we continue to cut the unproductive sale, driving clarity of message, increased productivity and higher sell-throughs.Furthermore, year to date, revenue per SKU is up 18% and gross profit per SKU is up 23% to last year. The focus on our icons was evident in our Fall and Holiday assortment. Our Polo Bear sweaters and novelty items embellished with our iconic symbols like our Crest Logo and Downhill Ski Racer graphic were among our best sellers for the season.Our renewed core items were also key to our seasonal performance. The sales trend in Polo, our largest brand, improved in both men's and women's apparels. This is a result of the work Ralph and our creative teams have been doing to elevate and evolve our core product with increased functionality and refreshed fabrics, silhouettes and color palettes.Some of our best performers included those with additional functionality such as Washable Merino Sweaters, outwear with seam seals, and denim and chinos with stretch. We saw increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year.",
                 'PPG': "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.John BrunoThank you, Denise, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2018 financial results conference call.Joining me on the call from PPG are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 18, 2018.

For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.Before introducing Michael, I would like to remind everyone that on October 8, PPG issued an update on third quarter financial results and guidance on fourth quarter earnings. Today we are confirming the fourth quarter guidance we provided on October 8.Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.Michael McGarryThank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 financial results. For the third quarter our net sales were approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.45. As we detailed in our preannouncement, we experienced increase raw material and logistic cost inflation in the quarter, with the third quarter representing the highest level of cost inflation since the trend began two years ago. We did not meet our elevated expectations for year-over-year performance. However we’ve made significant progress on increasing selling prices, have continued to aggressively manage our costs and have continued with capital deployment.For the third quarter our sales in local currencies increased by more than 3%. Reporting the higher local currency sales were selling price increase of more than 2% in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement over the prior sequential quarter. Our sales volumes were flat in aggregate, but up about 2% excluding the previously communicated customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings business. Foreign currency translation turn to a headwind, compared to third quarter 2017 as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter against several key currencies. Sales were unfavorably impacted by about $80 million from currency translation and pretax income unfavorably impacted by about $15 million. Looking at some of the business trends in the quarter, in the Performance Coating segment, aerospace coatings delivered another excellent quarter with more than 10% volume growth, led by above industry performance in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Architectural Coatings EMEA our organic sales increased a low single-digit in the quarter driven by higher selling prices. While overall sales volumes in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific decreased, we did continue to achieve high single-digit percentage organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canadian company owned stores.In addition, we continue to be pleased with the progress achieve to expand PPG’s offering at the Home Depot and we are proud to be named Supplier Partner of the Year at the Home Depot for the launch of the Olympic Stain and Timeless brands. Volumes grew at our Mexican PPG Comex business including the benefit of opening additional 40 stores during the quarter. Protective and marine coatings volumes increased with continued strong protected coating sales in Asia. The marine business had modestly higher new build volumes, which came off of a very low base. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales decreased by low single-digit percentage year-over-year trending lower as the quarter progressed. Volumes were impacted by lower demand in the U.S. and Europe, stemming from a change in customer order patterns, as several customers had high inventory levels due to lower end use market demand. ",
                 'PPL': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Andy Ludwig - PPL Corp.Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter results as well of our general business outlook. We're providing slides of this presentation on our website at www.pplweb.com.Any statements made in this presentation about future operating results or other future events are forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in the appendix to this presentation and at the company's SEC filings.We will refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure, on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the press release, which has been posted on our website and furnished to the SEC.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman, President and CEO.William H. Spence - PPL Corp.Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our third quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin and Paul Thompson, the heads of our U.S. utility businesses, and Phil Swift, Head of our Operations at Western Power Distribution in the UK.Moving to slide 3, given we will see many of you at EEI in a little over a week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning. Our agenda begins with highlights of our 2018 third quarter results, including an update to our 2018 earnings guidance. This will then provide an overview of our third quarter 2018 segment earnings results. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions at the end.Turning to slide 4, today, we announced strong third quarter reported earnings of $0.62 per share, resulting in a total of $2.01 per share to the first nine months of 2018. Adjusting for special items, primarily related to unrealized gains on our UK earnings hedges, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.59 per share, up over 5% from the $0.56 per share a year ago.On a year-to-date basis through September, ongoing earnings were $1.88 per share, up about 11% from the $1.70 per share a year ago, driven by higher earnings across all of our business segments.Given our strong year-to-date results, we have further narrowed our 2018 guidance range from $2.30 per share to $2.40 per share, raising the midpoint to $2.35 from $2.33 per share. In addition to delivering these strong financial results in the third quarter, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investment that benefit our customers.LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on September 28, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $170 million in electricity and gas-based rates. A more detailed breakdown of our rate requests can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. The requested increases will support continued monetization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability.In addition, the increases will support continued investment in our power plants to improve performance and minimize our impact on the environment. Our rate request also includes the proposed Green Tariff, aimed at spurring renewable energy growth and economic development in Kentucky.The Green Tariff will roll LG&E and KU's existing Green Energy program and solar offerings into one tariff to attract and retain businesses seeking these types of options. If approved by the Commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect in May of 2019. Even with the increases associated with these proposed investments, LG&E and KU rates would remain well below national averages.Shifting the focus to Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities ranked among the top 10% of utilities nationwide and a key reliability measure according to a report issued in the third quarter. The report issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers found PPL Electric had a lower rate of power outages than all but 5 of 93 utilities nationwide and the lowest outage frequency of utilities tracked in the Mid-Atlantic region. It's also worth noting that LG&E and KU are ranked in the top quartile nationally in terms of outage frequency according to the same report.This achievement reflects the value of PPL Electric's continued investments in smart grid technology, power line upgrades, vegetation management and data analytics that help drive improvement. The company's reliable service also has led to higher customer satisfaction.",
                 'PFG': "John EganThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Principal Financial Group's third quarter conference call. As always, materials related to today's call are available on our website at principal.com/investor. With the annual actuarial assumption review this quarter, we've included 2 additional slides in the earnings call presentation. We've entered a comparison of third quarter operating earnings, excluding significant variances as well as the income statement line item impacts of the 2018 actuarial assumption review and other significant variances.Following a reading of the safe harbor provision, CEO, Dan Houston; and CFO, Deanna Strable, will deliver some prepared remarks. Then, we will open up the call for questions. Others available for the Q&A session include Nora Everett, Retirement and Income Solutions; Luis Valdés, Principal International; Amy Friedrich, U.S. Insurance Solutions. While this is certainly not Tim Dunbar's first call, we want to welcome him in his new role as President of Global Asset Management.Some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The company does not revise or update them to reflect new information, subsequent events or changes in strategy. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied are discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Additionally, some of the comments made during this conference call may refer to the non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation.Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to extend an invitation to our 2018 Investor Day on the afternoon of Thursday, November 15 in New York City. Our leadership team will highlight future opportunities across our businesses and provide a deeper dive into our accelerated investment and digital strategies. Additionally, our 2019 outlook call will be held on December 3. Dan?Daniel HoustonThanks, John, and welcome. This morning, I'll share performance highlights and key accomplishments in helping clients and customers achieve financial security and success. Then, Deanna will provide additional details on financial results, including our significant variances during the quarter and capital deployment.For the third quarter, we reported $481 million of non-GAAP operating earnings. Excluding the significant variances that Deanna will discuss, non-GAAP operating earnings were $422 million, a 1% increase compared to strong results in the year ago quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.6 billion increased 9% from a year ago, reflecting solid net revenue growth, including the accelerated performance fee in the current quarter, ongoing expense discipline and the benefit of U.S. tax reform.I'd like to highlight the outstanding performance of the U.S. Insurance Solutions. Strong sales and retention and continued discipline drove a double-digit increase in pretax operating earnings over the trailing 12-month period. Beyond these strong results, this segment has a critical role in advancing our small- to medium-sized business strategy and growing our franchise. Though recent growth overall has been muted by our accelerated investment in digital strategies and unfavorable foreign currency translation, our fundamentals and industry opportunities remain intact.While we're continuing to face increasing fee pressure, particularly in our asset management business in the U.S. retirement business, I'm confident we're taking appropriate steps to combat these pressures, to differentiate the marketplace and to position Principal to continue to deliver above-market growth over the long term.With $668 billion at quarter end, we've increased assets under management by $12 billion or 2% compared to a year ago. Excluding the previously announced realignment of a real estate investment team within Principal Global Investors and the effect of the exchange rates, AUM would be up $40 billion or 6% compared to a year ago.Total company net cash flow was modestly positive for the quarter and the trailing 12 months but down from the prior year periods. Retirement and Income Solutions generated $4.8 billion of positive net cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This reflects strong sales in our pension risk transfer and fixed annuity businesses and RIS-Spread and strong sales retention and reoccurring deposits within RIS-Fee.Despite a soft third quarter, Principal international generated nearly $7 billion of positive net cash flows on a trailing 12-month basis, a 10% increase over the year ago period. We've gained meaningful traction in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong with $2.7 billion and $1 billion of positive net cash flow, respectively, over the trailing 12 months. Combined, these operations have generated net cash flows of 14% of beginning AUM over the trailing 12 months. China also improved over the trailing 12 months with nearly $38 billion of positive net cash flow compared to $12 billion of net outflows in the year ago period. Keep in mind, China is not included in reported net cash flow.",

We continued improving productivity while investing in our brands. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives, but we must and will do better than this. The ecosystems in which we operate around the world are being disrupted and transformed.We must change at an even faster rate winning through superiority, stronger cost and cash productivity and a strengthened organization and culture.

Fabric Care, Home Care and Personal Health Care are all growing share. Sales growth has been challenging in a very difficult market environment. We have large businesses in several difficult markets Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil collectively more than a 30-basis point top-line headwind.Retail trade transformation in the U.S. is reshaping our categories. Rapid shifts to e-commerce and aggressive inventory management, trade inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. drove strong organic sales down by roughly a point this quarter. From a business standpoint, we're not where we need to be on two large businesses, Baby Care and grooming. David will discuss both.The balance of the Company portfolio is growing organic sales over 3% fiscal year-to-date. We have opportunities continued to improve noticeable product, packaging, communication, go-to-market, and value superiority of our offerings across the portfolio and to fuel this with even increased levels of productivity, each of which we are committed to do.All-in sales were up 4% including about 3 point benefit from the net of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 1%. Organic sales growth was again volume driven with volume up 2%.We delivered solid organic sales growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Personal Health Care and Skin and Personal Care. Looking geographically, we delivered mid single-digit growth in Greater China, Japan, France and the Philippines; high single growth in Russia; double-digit organic sales growth in India and Turkey.E-commerce sales continue to be very strong, up more than 30% fiscal year-to-date. We are holding or growing e-commerce market share in 8 of our 10 product categories. This growth was partially offset by results in Baby Care and Grooming, both of which were down this quarter versus the prior year.Mix mainly from strong growth of premium priced products added 1 point to organic sales growth. Pricing rounded to a 2 point headwind on organic sales. On its face, the rounded number may appear like a substantial increase in pricing investment, unrounded it’s about 1.5 points, about 30 basis points different than last quarter with some factors driving the pricing now starting to annualize.U.S. Gillette pricing interventions reduced organic sales by about 30 basis points. We annualized the price change at the start of this month and we expect stronger sales going forward. The U.S. Oral Care business recently rescinded the list price increase they've taken last year in the U.S., which left us operated at an unsustainable price premium. This dynamic is causing a short-term negative price impact as well that would start annualize in July.Fabric and Home Care pricing is lower due to promotional investments to maintain competitiveness in the U.S. and Europe. These two will annualize later this calendar year. Looking forward, we will continue to ensure our brands inclusive of product performance, remain an excellent competitive value for consumers. This will include price increases and mix improvement as we bring new meaningful benefits to market.We will also price to offset rising commodity costs when the degree of the cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. With this plus the annualization of key investments, we currently expect to return to positive price trends some time next fiscal year. On the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $0.95, up 2% versus the prior year. This includes $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.01 of non-core charges related to the tax act.Core earnings per share were $1, up 4%. Our operating margin declined to 100 basis points. Our gross margin declined to 110 basis points due mainly to higher commodity and freight costs. Core SG&A cost decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. Productivity savings and cost of goods and SG&A were a 310 basis point benefit for the quarter.The core effective tax rate was 21%; 2 points below the year ago level due mainly to the impact of the U.S. tax act. This benefit was partially offset by increased interest expense and currency swap cost as we optimized international cash management under the new U.S. tax laws. The rate was somewhat lower than we anticipated last quarter as we continue to gain a deeper understanding of the provisions enacted as part of the tax act.",
                 'PLD': "I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.Tracy WardThanks, Emily, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.Additionally our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance; and then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company's outlook. Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today.With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started.Tom OlingerThanks, Tracy. Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.First, I'll start with an update on our $8.5 billion acquisition of DCT. Our financial and operating results reflect this mid-quarter transaction which closed on August 22. The integration went exceptionally well and is complete and we refinanced the $1.8 billion debt we assumed in the transaction at an average interest rate of 2.4% in a term of over 13 years.We've already hit our expected annual synergies run rate of $80 million with the vast majority of that in cash savings. Now, our focus is on realizing the incremental $40 million of future annual value creation from development and revenue synergies.Turning to market conditions, fundamentals remain healthy and well located space continues to be in high demand. There were several notable bankruptcies announced recently and our exposure to these firms is minimal. These customers leased from us about less than 30 basis points of our net effective rent.We've been monitoring these companies for some time and are confident we'll be able to quickly lease up any spaces we get back from these customers at higher rent given they're approximately 10% below market. Broadly we feel very good about our business. Market rents across our portfolio are growing in line with our forecast with Europe slightly ahead.Switching to results, core FFO for the third quarter was $0.72 per share. Our share of cash same store NOI growth was 5.9%, led by the U.S. at 7.1%. Our share net effective rent change on roll was more than 22% and was also led by the U.S. at over 30%. Occupancy was up more than 120 basis points year-over-year to 97.5%, with Europe at 98%, up 260 basis points over the same period.Leasing volume totaled approximately 37 million square feet with an average term of more than five years. This includes 5.3 million square feet of development leasing. Development stabilizations in the third quarter had an estimated margin of 36%, bringing our year-to-date total value creation of $475 million. So far this year we've realized $329 million in gains on the monetization of development projects.Disposition and contribution activity in the quarter was approximately $460 million. As previously announced, we closed the $1.1 billion sale to Maple Tree in early October with our share of the proceeds totaling over $600 million. We expect to close the second phase of this transaction totaling $170 million by year end.During the quarter we reduced our weighted average interest rate to 2.7% and extended our weighted average term to six years through the issuance of long duration tenors up to 30 years. Our balance sheet remains one of the best in the business and we continue to access capital globally at attractive terms.Our $3.5 billion of liquidity and over $6 billion in potential fund rebalancing allow us flexibility to self fund our development well into the next decade. This substantial amount of dry powder positions us to capitalize on attractive deployment opportunities as market dislocations arise.Looking forward, I know many of you are looking for 2019 guidance but you'll have to wait until our fourth quarter call, as this is our normal practice. For 2018 guidance, I'll cover the highlights on our share basis. So, for complete detail refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Also note, our guidance includes the impact of the DCT acquisition.",
                 'PRU': "Darin Arita - Prudential Financial, Inc.Thank you, Tawny. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions.Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com.Also as a reminder, we will be hosting our 2019 Financial Outlook call on December 6th at 11:00 a.m. Eastern. In the call, we plan to provide our 2019 EPS guidance range. We hope that you will be able to join us.And with that I will hand it over to John.John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the continued momentum our businesses. During the quarter, we rolled out and expanded initiatives to deliver financial opportunity to more and more people around the world. We produced sustainable returns and strong business growth and maintained a solid capital position while distributing $755 million to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we announced leadership succession plans that reflected a thoughtful, multi-year process by our board and our organization's emphasis on talent and culture. I'm confident that our next generation of leadership led by Charlie and Rob alongside our seasoned management team will continue our momentum for many years to come.We also welcome the Financial Stability Oversight Council's decision earlier last month to rescind Prudential's designation as a systemically important financial institution. We believe this outcome reflects Prudential sustainable business model, capital strength, and comprehensive risk management framework, which have and continue to enable us to fulfill our promises to our customers to deliver consistent performance and to meet regulatory obligations.Turning to slide 3. I will provide some additional financial highlights on the third quarter. We produced an annualized operating return on equity of 13.5%, above our near-to-intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.15, up 5% from $3.01 last year, driven by business growth, tax reform, and capital management.Net income was higher in the year-ago period, reflecting gains on derivatives. Our adjusted book value per share of $95.20 is up 12% over the prior year. This reflects the earnings we generated, as well as the impact of tax reform and accounting changes implemented at the start of 2018. These items were partially offset by the payment of $3.45 per share of common stock dividends totaling $1.1 billion and about $1.4 billion of share repurchases over the past year.Our performance for the third quarter was driven by momentum across our businesses, which worked together to serve the needs of our individual customers, distribution partners, and institutional clients.Here are a few highlights from the quarter. PGIM, which is our global investment management business continued to produce positive net flows, this time of $8.7 billion for the quarter. Our Retirement business had record account values of $447 billion, including net flows of 6 billion driven by our pension risk transfer and full service sales. Our Individual Annuities business produced sales of $2.2 billion, which were 69% higher than a year-ago quarter, and up 8% sequentially. And we also continued to generate steady growth across our International businesses.Now turning to slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on Prudential's financial wellness initiatives, which are helping us build deeper relationships that address the changing financial needs of our customers. We're using technology to deliver the full breadth and depth of our collective businesses, so that we can enter new market segments and address an increasingly diverse range of customer needs and financial challenges.One recent example is the launch of LINK by Prudential, an online experience that helps individuals visualize their financial goals. LINK connects individuals with solutions and financial professionals to help them with their unique goals from investment and retirement, to safeguarding the future of loved ones. One can access LINK via our Prudential.com website or through an employer where LINK is enabled through our digital financial wellness platform.",
                 'PEG': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Carlotta Chan. Please go ahead.Carlotta ChanThank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you for participating in our earnings call. Earlier today, PSEG released earning statements for the third quarter of 2018. These materials including the release, financial attachments and accompanying slides detailing operating results by company are posted on the IR website at investor.pseg.com. Our 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2018 will be filed shortly.The earnings release and other matters we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which differ from net income as reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements are posted on our IR website and are included in today's live and in our earnings release.I would now like to turn the call over to Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Public Service Enterprise Group. Joining Ralph on the call is Dan Craig, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of their remarks, there will be time for your questions. Ralph.Ralph IzzoThank you Carlotta, and thank you all for joining us today. PSEG reported solid results for the third quarter and through nine months. We are updating full year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance by narrowing the range to $3.05 to $3.15 per share. With an increased contribution from PSE&G, balancing lower expected results at PSEG Power and the parent. The midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged and continues to represent a 6% increase above 2017 full year results.This morning we reported net income for the third quarter of $0.81 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 per share versus net income of $0.78 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.82 per share in the year ago. Third quarter net income and non-GAAP operating earnings improved by 4% and 16%, respectively over 2017’s third quarter comparables. Our results for the quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the nine months to $2.56 per share, an 8% increase over the $2.36 per share earned in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Slide 6 and 7 summarize the results of the quarter and year-to-date periods. Throughout a very hot summer both PSE&G and Power performed well. Therefore, our financial results reflect solid contributions from both businesses. PSE&G’s earnings increased by $0.05 per share up 10% over third quarter 2017 results, driven primarily by continued investment in transmission and distribution programs, focused on increasing system resiliency and reliability. Warmer than normal weather increased electric demand for air conditions throughout an extended summer that was the second hottest in nearly half a century.Expanded investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure continues to benefit customers and have a favorable impact on PSE&Gs rate base and earnings. We are on pace to spend $2.8 billion for the year and the utilities rate basis is forecasted to grow to almost $19 billion at year-end. Based on our various investments programs, we remain comfortable with PSE&Gs ability to achieve growth in rate base within our forecasted of 8% to 10% per year for the five year period ending in 2022.We have made significant progress to date in our regulatory and policy partnerships. PSE&G recently filed several clean energy future investment programs totaling $3.6 billion over six years. These filings continue the alignment of PSEGs capital investment plans with New Jersey's energy policy goals by inventing a broad range of programs and energy efficiency, electric vehicle infrastructure and energy storage.The inclusion of what we are calling energy cloud or AMI is consistent with the BP use recommendations for improving storm response following the March 2018 nor'easters in which they directed each utility to submit a plan and cost benefit analysis for the implementation of AMI, focusing on reducing customer outages and outage durations. PSE&G’s filing is designed to create an advanced technology network and upgrade 2.2 million electric meters to smart meters by the year 2024.In addition, Energy Strong to the proposed $2.5 billion five year extension of our infrastructure reliability and resiliency investment program is pending at the BPU. Inclusive of the AMI initiative, PSE&G’s 2018 to 2022 capital spending forecast range is $12 billion to $16 billion.",
                 'PSA': 'Ryan BurkeThank you, Holly. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the third quarter 2018 earnings call. I am here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle.Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements other than statements of historical fact included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements. These risks and other factors could adversely impact our business and future results that are described in yesterday’s earnings release and our reports filed with the SEC. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 31, 2018 and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. You can find our press release, SEC reports and an audio webcast replay of this conference call on our website, publicstorage.com.With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.Joe RussellGreat. Thank you, Ryan and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter. I’d like to open the call for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Juan SanabriaHi, good morning. I am just hoping you guys could speak a little bit about your tech initiatives, I think you guys have launched a new web platform which is pretty all-encompassing. I was hoping you could just give us an update on that and the benefits you have seen and how that should impact core results and earnings over time?Joe RussellOkay. Thanks Juan. Yes, the frontline or customer interface system you are talking to is what we call Web Champ 2. So Web Champ 2 is both the interface from customers to employees and it’s also our inventory system. It has a number of attributes that we built over several years and fully now have implemented it throughout the company. We started integrating it into our properties in early 2017 to finish by the end of the year. So now we are coming up to a full year of its use. And the levels of benefits tied to it are several. First of all, it’s built around a very high degree of customer interface. So, it includes speed of transactions, knowledge of customer, tools that the property manager and the district manager can use to enhance not only our movement activity, but the ways in which other ways in which we can encourage our customers to stay with us. And it’s also a paperless system. So, it has a number of other advantages relative to just the day-to-day operations as well. Now, those are some of the headlines of the system. The other things that over time it will continue to give us benefits around are the ways in which that we grow and understand customer behavior and the knowledge that we have relative to not only the existing customers, plus or minus today about 1.5 million customers, so we got a big pool of existing customers, but even year-to-date, we have moved in nearly 900,000 customers. So the system is working great. We are getting a lot of good traction out of it. It’s a system that we can continue, like I mentioned continues to enhance over time and its inherent design is included in a number of things that we integrate from, again, customer sourcing, revenue management and other things, but a lot of that’s highly proprietary. But I can tell you that we are very pleased with the success the system is bringing to us and efficiencies and knowledge that we continued to gain to optimize our overall environment.Juan SanabriaGreat. And then just a follow-up question if you don’t mind on the occupancy front from a same-store perspective that’s kind of declined consistently the last few quarters, at what point do you think that you will have easier comps and that occupancy will stabilize at least from the same-store perspective?Tom BoyleSure. Juan, so it’s Tom speaking. Occupancy trends throughout the year have frankly been encouraging on a year-over-year basis. So while we have had year-over-year declines we have seen some positive momentum there. And the hurricanes this quarter in particular mask some of that benefit. So if you look at the occupancy at quarter end for example which was down 1.2%, if you look at the system as a whole excluding the hurricane markets it’s down 0.8%. So there have been some positive trends there. I think generally speaking, we have talked about this in the past with system as a whole before supply really started impacting us in 2016 was north of 96% occupied and there is no question we have been impacted by the opening of new facilities. In many markets which I won’t rattle off here as you know them where occupancy has been more impacted than otherwise. Looking at our markets this quarter we are still looking at Los Angeles 95.4%, San Francisco 94.8%, so very healthy occupancies. And again system wide, I think we are seeing some encouraging trends as we step through 2018.',
                 'PHM': "James ZeumerGreat. Thank you, David, and good morning. I apologize if there's been some confusion on the dial-in numbers but hopefully we've got everybody in. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's call, which is to review PulteGroup's third quarter earnings. I'm joined on the call this morning by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance.A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post a copy of today -- a replay of today's call to our website a little later on. Before I turn the call over to Ryan Marshall, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?Ryan MarshallThanks, Jim, and good morning. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss PulteGroup's strong third quarter results and the operating and financial gains we continue to realize. Given a quarter in which our revenues grew by 25%, our operating margin gained 190 basis points and our earnings per share increased 74%.I would typically focus my opening comments on the strength of our Q3 numbers. But when housing stocks drop over 20% during that same period, it may be more useful to start with the review of market conditions as this seems to be an area of focus for our investors. Based on industry dynamics, we maintain our positive view on the housing market and the overall sustainability of the current housing recovery. We fully appreciate, however, that operating conditions have changed over the past several months. We continue to actively assess the impact of rising interest rates and are making adjustments on a community-by-community basis to manage pace and price to achieve appropriate returns. That being said, let me provide a few high-level data points to consider, as it may provide some additional insight on what's happening in the market.Buyer traffic into our communities in Q3 was up 15% over last year, and the year-over-year gains accelerated as we moved through the quarter. To us, the increasing volume of consumer traffic indicates that homebuying interest remains high. While traffic into our communities was up in the quarter, company-wide absorption pace was down. These data points, along with the feedback from our sales teams, suggest that affordability may be becoming a bigger hurdle for potential buyers to overcome. For some buyers the problem may be an inability to qualify for a mortgage. For other buyers the bigger difficulty may be wondering if now is still a good time to buy or even questioning the perceived value of a new home, especially if the purchase requires giving up an exceptionally low mortgage rate they locked in a few years ago. Whether the hurdles are real or perceived the resulting impact was that the conversion rate of prospect to contract signing was down in Q3. We had talked about this lower conversion rate on our last earnings call and how it started to slow when mortgage rates begin ticking up in May. It certainly isn't new news that home prices have been marching higher, almost since this recovery started in 2011 and even accelerated in response to rising costs over the past year.Now layering on top of elevated home prices is a rise in mortgage rates, which are up roughly 50 basis points over the past six months. This combination of high income -- high home prices and more expensive financing has created a bit of sticker shock, while making it harder for some buyers to achieve their desired monthly payment.Market conditions may be more competitive but the key underpinnings of the business remain positive. Supporting the demand side is GDP growth, exceeding 3%, low unemployment, high consumer confidence and wage growth. We also believe that the industry continues to under build relative to demand. This is helping keep supply in check as evidenced by the fact that there's less than four months of inventory of new and existing homes on the market.Looking at today's overall market dynamics, we see an environment where housing can continue along the gradual growth trajectory it's been on for the past seven years. Buyer interest remains high, inventories remain low with land and labor constraints helping to reduce the risk of overbuilding. Higher rates and affordability concerns may be issues, but some combination of adjustments in price and/or income or simply even just the passage of time should help consumers to get over these hurdles. In what we view as a good operating environment, but one that is arguably more challenging than 6 to 9 months ago, we are well positioned to deliver ongoing financial success.",
                 'PVH': "The information being made available includes forward-looking statements that reflect PVH's view as of November 29, 2018 of future events and financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties indicated in the Company's SEC filings and the Safe Harbor statement included in the press release that is the subject of this call. These risks and uncertainties include PVH's rights to change its strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, and its need to use significant cash flow to service its debt obligations. Therefore, the Company's future results of operations could differ materially from historical results or current expectations. PVH does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, including, without limitation, any estimate regarding revenue or earnings.Generally, the financial information and guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and identified under SEC rules. Reconciliations to GAAP amounts are included in PVH's third quarter 2018 earnings release, which can be found on www.pvh.com and in the Company's current report on Form 8-K furnished in the SEC in connection with the release.At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Mr. Manny Chirico, Chairman and CEO of PVH. Please go ahead.Manny ChiricoThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining me on the call. Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations are also on the call. I’m pleased with our earnings performance in the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations, driven by the power of our diversified global business model. We continued to over deliver against our 2018 earnings plan and are raising our full year earnings outlook based on our third quarter outperformance and our confidence in the opportunities for the fourth quarter, despite the recent bankruptcies in the U.S. and the UK, and increasing geopolitical volatility around the world.In the quarter, consolidated revenues grew 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, while our earnings per share of $3.21 for the quarter was $0.08 above the top end of our guidance, despite a $0.06 unplanned charge relating to Sears and the House of Fraser bankruptcy. This earnings beat was driven by the outperformance of our Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage brands businesses, partially offset by the underperformance of our Calvin Klein businesses, and I’ll get into the discussion about our three brands momentarily, but I think first let me touch on our regional performance.Our international businesses continue to experience momentum, driven by strong growth in Europe, where our performance has been outstanding. Our brands are very desirable, and we are gaining share with both new and existing consumers. In Asia, our business performed well as a whole. I do want to note that while our Chinese business performed well and was ahead of plan, we have experienced some softer trends in traffic relating to a softening economy and the related trade concerns between China and the U.S. Despite this backdrop, we continue to see strong results out of China. I’m pleased to report that we continue to see healthy trends in our North American business, particularly in our wholesale businesses.In our retail business, we are experiencing growth with our domestic consumers, particularly at Tommy Hilfiger, yet we continue to experience a slowdown in international tourist traffic in the U.S. relative to the strength we experienced in the first six months of the year.From a digital sales point of view, we continue to see growth at an outpaced rate with revenues growing over 20% across our third party and our owned and operated businesses. Again, our digital sales for the company represent about 10% of total revenues. We are off to a strong start in the fourth quarter and including an excellent Black Friday weekend. As we look to the full year, we are raising our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share at the high end of our range. It is important to note that we are projecting underlying business to be more than $0.10 per share, covering an incremental FX headwind related to the strengthening U.S. dollar and the unplanned write offs related to our Sears and House of Fraser businesses.Our new earnings per share guidance range implies a year-over-year EPS growth of 18%, and we continue to prudently forecast our holiday season, especially given the strong start to the fourth quarter business. Mike will further quantify some of those results.Now moving to our brands results, let me begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy Hilfiger had a truly outstanding quarter, continuing the outperformance we’ve had delivered throughout the year. The brand continues to experience global momentum with strength across all product lines and channels of distribution. This has been fueled by strong product offerings and consistent brand execution around the world. We believe that our consumer-centric brand approach is helping us gain meaningful market share, particularly on the younger end of the age spectrum. For example, Tommy’s capsule collection, with streetwear label Kith sold out online in 37 minutes. Notably, our recent brand studies have confirmed the average age of a consumer has come down several years as we continue to connect with more millennials and GenZ.",
                 'QRVO': 'Douglas ToledoThanks, very much, Rebecca. Hello, everyone and welcome to Qorvo’s third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.In today’s release and on today’s call we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide the supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com under Investors. In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up.Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo’s Mobile Products Group and James Klein, President of Qorvo’s Infrastructure and Defense Products Group as well as other members of Qorvo’s management team.And with that, I will hand the call over to Bob.Bob BruggeworthThank you, Doug. Qorvo delivered an exceptional December quarter, with revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance range. In infrastructure and defense, quarterly revenue grew 20% year-over-year to a record $203 million led by strength in defense, IoT and GaN. In mobile products, revenue increased sequentially to $642 million led by a very strong ramp in support of our largest customer. The December quarter played out largely as expected. IDP’s business continued to strengthen, while smartphone ramps were consistent with our expectations.Beginning late in the quarter, demand trends in mobile deteriorated at our largest customer and also in China. This weakness is impacting our near-term expectations and is reflected in our guidance for the March quarter. As we look forward, we expect continued robust growth in IDP in 2018 and in mobile we are gearing up for an aggressive ramp of a custom mid/high-band PAD in the second half of the calendar year. This is the most valuable and highly integrated placement in mobile RF representing what we call the integration hub in the main path of the RF system. This is a significant customer validation of our BAW technology and multiplexing expertise. Coupled with gains in antenna tuning and envelope tracking we expect this to drive another generation of year-over-year growth with these top customers.Across the mobile landscape, leading phone manufacturers and baseband suppliers are adopting more highly integrated mid/high-band architectures. This is increasing the customer demand for high order BAW-based multiplexing from industry leaders like Qorvo and we are migrating a greater percentage of our design resources to higher volume BAW-based RF solutions. To that end, we have sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to another Tier 1 smart phone customer for our 2019 platform. In addition to these engagements with marquee customers, we have commenced production of our next-generation RF Fusion portfolio for Phase 6 architectures, including both mid/high-band and low band integrated fab modules. This solution supports all major cellular frequency bands and more efficiently enables key regional carrier aggregation combinations. In both premium and performance to your smart phones, mobile products, is targeting the most valuable opportunities with the highest barriers to entry. Premium filters clearly fit within this category as do antenna tuners, envelope trackers, antenna plexers and our integrated mid/high and low mid/high solutions featuring our BAW filters.In China, mobile operators are requiring improved data throughput across a larger percentage of smartphones this year. China Unicom and China Telecom recently mandated Band 1 and Band 3 downlink carrier aggregation and handsets above RMB 1,500 for the mass market for higher tier handsets that was greater than RMB 3,000, China Mobile recently mandated Band 40 and Band 41 downlink carrier aggregations. Phones with these features are expected to be available as early as the middle of this calendar year. Supporting our long-term outlook, we see a broad slate of new applications emerging in cellular IoT, which can support billions of incremental units. Qorvo recently announced the co-development of the industry’s smallest low power system-in-package module with Nordic Semiconductor for global LTE-M and narrowband IoT applications. This opportunity includes the PA, switch, controller dye as well as model design and manufacturing, including our proprietary integrated RF shielding.',

Duke?Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Quanta Services third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments we welcome your questions.I'm pleased to report that Quanta achieved record revenues, operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share for the quarter and first nine months of the year. We ended the quarter with record total and 12-month backlog of $12.2 billion and $7.5 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Quanta had more than 41,000 employees who worked nearly 63 million man-hours during the first nine months of the year and we are well on pace to finish the year with record man-hours.This is indicative of record levels of activity in our end markets and strong demand for Quanta's solutions, which provide world-class execution and cost certainty for our customers' maintenance and capital programs. We have executed well this year and believe our record year-to-date results and full year guidance demonstrate our strong competitive position in the marketplace and favorable multi-year demand for our services. We also believe our results reflect the benefits of operational diversity and our portfolio approach to managing risk.We continue to expect that 2018 will be a record year for Quanta. To that end, we are increasing our revenue expectations, maintaining the midpoint of our adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations, and increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2018. Perhaps, more importantly, we are experiencing strengthening demand in our base business and for larger projects, which solidifies our outlook for earnings growth in 2019.Our Electric Power operations continue to perform well from both a top line and margin perspective. The strong performance in the third quarter was driven by solid execution across our Electric Power operations from base business activity to storm response and larger transmission projects.In response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we deployed several thousand line workers and support personnel, who worked safely and tirelessly to restore power alongside our customers. They have worked long hours for many days and I want to thank them for their dedication to safety and hard work.",
                 'QCOM': "I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead.John T. Sinnott - Qualcomm, Inc.Thank you and good afternoon, everyone.Today's call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, Alex Rogers, and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today.During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G, and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website.We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business or industry trends, or business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.And now for comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.Steven M. Mollenkopf - Qualcomm, Inc.Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.We reported very strong results this quarter, which I will comment on shortly, but first I want to update you on the status of the NXP transaction. As you've seen from our press release, pending any new material developments, we intend to terminate our agreement to acquire NXP at the end of the day.The decision for us to move forward without NXP was a difficult one. Continued uncertainty overhanging such a large acquisition introduces heightened risk. We weighed that risk against the likelihood of a change in the current geopolitical environment, which we didn't believe was a high probability outcome in the near future.In the end, we determined this was the best path forward for our customers, partners, employees, and stockholders. To say the least, the 21 months since we announced the NXP acquisition have been volatile. In spite of all the potential distractions, Qualcomm and NXP leadership remained focused on laying the foundation for the successful integration of our two companies.I want to personally thank Rick Clemmer and his management team for being tremendous partners and compliment them on the excellent company they have built at NXP.Consistent with our prior commitment to return capital that was previously earmarked for the NXP acquisition, our board has approved a new $30 billion stock repurchase authorization. We intend to execute on a large majority of the authorization by the end of fiscal 2019.The rationale for the NXP acquisition was to accelerate our strategy of growing into adjacent opportunities where mobile compute was becoming ubiquitous. This strategy remains unchanged. Over the past two years, we continued to leverage the powerful industry dynamics of mobile everywhere. The results of these efforts are strongly evidenced in the growth of our adjacencies and RF front-end opportunities, which we estimate will contribute to our fiscal year, ending this September, approximately $5 billion in revenue, up more than 70% in the last two years.In key industries like auto, our pipeline of awarded design wins has expanded dramatically this year to $5 billion, up $2 billion from January, as auto makers and Tier 1 suppliers leverage the strength of our roadmap and begin gearing up for 5G-enabled cars in 2021. Our infotainment solutions account for more than half of the $5 billion pipeline, just four years after we announced our entry in this category.We've continued to gain share in Wi-Fi and have now achieved leading positions in several Wi-Fi segments. Our Snapdragon franchise has moved well beyond mobile devices, becoming the leading platform in areas like AR and VR, and is positioned to be a critical enabler in AI and machine learning at the edge. We are also transforming the notebook segment to a true smartphone experience and are growing our ecosystem of partners, including recently adding Samsung.Our industrial IoT product revenues are also growing rapidly and are on track to double this fiscal year versus two years ago. We anticipate our addressable opportunity in the industrial IoT space to grow at approximately a 20% CAGR over the next few years, and we expect to exceed that growth for our industrial IoT revenues.",
                 'DGX': "Now, I like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please, go ahead.Shawn BevecThank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected.Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics’ future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense.As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018 and was adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concessions, as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.Steve RusckowskiThanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I’ll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on third quarter performance and give you an update on our outlook for 2018.We grew revenues and continued to deliver strong earnings growth in the quarter. Revenues were up nearly 2%, despite the effect of industry headwinds we called out last quarter. Reported EPS was up more than 32% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew more than 25%. As you saw, we have revised our full-year revenue guidance to reflect lower than expected revenueperformance this year, which was affected primarily by two factors.First, as we detailed in the second quarter, we faced headwinds in the areas of prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C, and vitamin D testing. While we made some progress, these testing areas continued to impact revenue growth in the third quarter. Second, in the third quarter, we also saw a rise in patient concessions, which Mark will touch on later.Before getting into the details of the progress we’ve made in the quarter, I'd like to provide context on some market trends, starting with an update on PAMA. Last month, a US District Court judge dismissed on narrow procedural grounds our trade association’s lawsuit over the implementation of new Medicare pricing for lab tests under PAMA.The Court’s opinion, however, acknowledges that ACLA’s arguments on the merits raise important questions, about HHS’s actions. This is, of course, disappointing for our industry; and it is potentially harmful to Medicare beneficiaries.Last week, ACLA appealed the District Court’s decision, demanding a hearing on the merits. At the same time, the industry continues to pursue a legislative fix. Additionally, CMS and our industry continues to work together on addressing the current PAMA issues. So, as we sit here today, PAMA is having an impact on Quest and the rest of the lab market.Increasingly, smaller independent labs and hospital outreach labs are struggling financially, due to lower Medicare reimbursement, not only directly due to PAMA, but also under contracts with pricing indexed to Medicare. Some have begun to exit the business, citing PAMA as a factor. We’re continuing to plan and manage our business as if PAMA is here to stay.At the same time, there has been increasing scrutiny of the wide variation in health care pricing in the popular press. Consumers and employers, who pay for most of healthcare, are becoming more price sensitive. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that health plans that exclude costly providers can be much less expensive for consumers and employers. Quest offers a great customer experience, and coupled with our scale and efficiency, it makes us an exceptional value in the market, compared with hospital outreach labs, which often charge two-to-five times more than Quest. So, in short, there are three reasons we believe the market will continue to consolidate and therefore afford us an opportunity to accelerate growth.First, reduced reimbursement through the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule is beginning to have an impact on the laboratory industry. Second, health plans are embarking on a new strategy, looking to national labs to help drive efficiency in lab spending. And the finally, consumers and their employers are more attuned to the variation in healthcare pricing.Turning to the third quarter, I’ll review our execution against the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions. We announced three acquisitions in the third quarter, which strengthen our capabilities in several key areas.First, our acquisition of PhenoPath, which has a strong record of innovation, provides several capabilities that complement and extend our own, particularly in the area of pathology and molecular oncology. It also expands our presence in the Pacific Northwest.",
                 'RJF': "Now I will turn it over to Paul Shoukry, Treasure and Head of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.Paul ShoukryThank you, Rae, and thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I’ll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, acquisitions, our ability to successfully recruit and integrate financial advisors, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or general economic conditions.In addition, words such as believes, expects, plans and future conditional verbs as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note that forward-looking statements are subject to risks and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q which are available on our Web site.During today's call, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?Paul ReillyThanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I’m actually calling you from Orlando, Florida where we have our Private Client Group employee division’s summer development conference which is a conference full of educational and communicational opportunity for our advisors.And unique to the Raymond James’ culture, we actually have slightly more children under 18 than advisors attending. It’s a family-oriented event. Really highlights the difference in the Raymond James culture and we believe it is part of the reason you see such low turnover statistics in our Private Client Group because of our culture.This morning, I’m going to kind of give some highlights over the results and I’m going to turn it over to Jeff Julien who will go over some of the details especially in the expense items which I know you’re going to have questions about, and then I’ll close with a little bit about the outlook for next quarter before we turn it over to you for questions.So in looking at the tone of really looking at the call, I think the results are better than they appear. The revenue drivers were all very strong and we did have certain elevated expense items that we believe were higher this quarter than they will be going forward and hopefully some of them were temporarily elevated, but we’ll get into that in a little bit.First, I want to start by our revenue metrics I believe were very, very strong, 1.84 billion, up 13% over last year’s quarter and up 1% sequentially. In fact, we have quarterly net revenue records in three of our four business segments, including the Private Client Group, the Bank and Asset Management.Capital Markets in the ECM side had very strong numbers which we’ll talk about in the segment, but really held back by a tough fixed income market environment where the fixed income division is really struggling given the environment; doing well versus competitors but struggling.I think most importantly if you look at the end of the third quarter, if you look at our key go-forward drivers, we ended with record assets under administration of 754.3 billion, up 14% over last year’s quarter, up 3% sequentially even more than the market relative to that quarter.We had assets under management of 135.5 billion, up 49% but of course that included the Scout and Reams acquisition versus a year ago quarter but up 2% sequentially, again good numbers given the market.We had record number of FAs of 7,719, up 115 in this quarter alone. We’re in a record recruiting pace this year and record net loans at the Bank of $19 billion and also an interest rate hike in June which should trail through in the next quarter. So I’m very pleased overall with our revenue and asset growth and positioning going forward.The sequential decline in our income I’m sure was a bit disappointing but let me touch on some of the reasons and Jeff will get into more detail so you’ll have perspective. Our quarterly net income of 232.3 million was up 27% over a year ago quarter, down 4% sequentially where we earned a $1.55 per fully diluted share, up 25% over a year ago quarter and down 5% sequentially. The sequential decline was really almost entirely resulting in two areas this quarter; one was business development and the other one was other expenses.",
                 'RTN': "I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.Thank you, Candace. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slide will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move on to questions.Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone.Raytheon once again delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter. Sales increased 8.3% and our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were all better than expected. We continue to see strong global demand for our advanced solutions. Book-to-bill in the third quarter was 1.28, driven equally by international and domestic. And, for the second time this year, we achieved record backlog, which rose to $41.6 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of nearly $5 billion year-over-year. Given this and the opportunities we see in the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our bookings outlook for the year by another $1 billion.It's worth noting that since the beginning of this year, we have increased our bookings outlook by a total of $2 billion over our original expectation and we now expect a full-year book-to-bill ratio of over 1.1. We are pleased with our bookings performance this year, which positions us well for continued growth in 2019. Toby will discuss additional details about our initial 2019 outlook along with our third quarter performance and updates to guidance in a few minutes.Given the growth of the DoD budget and upcoming competitions we see for advanced solutions, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our strategy to continuously innovate and refresh the technology in our current franchises and to use that expertise to create new franchises.We try to be the disruptors of our own technology and make investments in order to keep our franchises relevant, so they continue to be value generators for decades to come. We demonstrated this in the innovative solutions we featured at AUSA earlier this month. First, we received positive feedback from our customer on the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle. We are leveraging our strong international partnerships on Lynx just as we have done with our Naval Strike Missile and the NASAMS System. For this, we are collaborating with Rheinmetall on the Lynx vehicle to meet the U.S. Army's requirement for the next-generation combat vehicle.Our global industry team will offer the Lynx paired with Raytheon's sensors, weapons and systems integration expertise to provide the army with a modern fighting vehicle that will keep U.S. soldiers far ahead of battlefield threats for decades to come.Next, we featured our TOW system, which is the premier, long-range heavy assault, precision weapon system used throughout the world today. Raytheon and the U.S. Army have consistently upgraded TOW since it was first produced in 1970 to keep it relevant for today's fight and help our soldiers preserve their overmatched advantage on the battlefield.Earlier this year, we were awarded a contract by the Army to develop a new propulsion system for the TOW missile. The improved system will increase range and deliver enhanced protection for ground troops while providing them with more capability. Also on display at AUSA was our upgraded Excalibur precision-guided projectile. This new variant, Excalibur Shaped Trajectory, or EST, represents a major leap forward in capability for this already advanced guided munition and enables soldiers to eliminate targets in hard-to-reach locations by offering a new angle of attack. In addition to EST, Raytheon has developed a laser-guided version in a five-inch sea-based variant of Excalibur.",
                 'O': "Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2018 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.Janeen BedardDuring this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q.We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate.I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy.Sumit RoyThanks, Janeen. Welcome to our call today. I am honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I am excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified high quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities, and most importantly our talented team.I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I am confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders.I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the Company into what it is today and we wish him the very best. In my seven years with the Company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let’s turn to the business.We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio.Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low-end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02, from $3.16 to $3.21, to a range of $3.18 to $3.21. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties just over 12% of rental revenue.Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with the service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business.We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with ecommerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate with the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics.We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years.Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018. During the quarter, we released 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent.Year-to-date, we have released 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were released.Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the releases have contractual rent increases.Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.Paul MeurerThanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date.",
                 'RHT': 'Tom McCallumThank you, Elise. Hello, everyone and welcome to Red Hat’s earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal ‘18. Speakers for today’s call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO and Eric Shander, Executive Vice President and CFO.Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and maybe downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page you will be able to find a copy of today’s prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics that, along with our earnings press release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.During this call we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events and trends, including guidance for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we know today and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today’s earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today’s call.And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim.Jim WhitehurstThank you Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today’s call. I am pleased to share that Red Hat delivered another strong quarter, with financial results exceeding our guidance across each metric. Demand remains strong for our hybrid cloud technologies and Red Hat is one of the key beneficiaries based on the breadth and depth of our solution portfolio as we have a proven track record of delivering significant business value to our customers.Red Hat is increasingly viewed as one of the top strategic technology partners to enterprise organizations, which is evidenced by our growing number of seven figure and multi-seven figure transactions. As we look ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to close out the fiscal year on a positive note and we have again increased our guidance for fiscal ‘18, as Eric will detail in a moment.Some of the financial highlights of the third quarter were subscription revenue growth of 21% year-over-year and our third consecutive quarter of approximately 20% total revenue growth in constant currency. These top line results were driven by: first, consistent subscription revenue growth for our infrastructure-related offerings which include bare metal RHEL, virtualized RHEL and RHEL on the public cloud; second, consistent subscription revenue growth of more than 40% in our application development related and other emerging technology offerings; third, our services revenue growth continues to outperform our expectations as consulting projects for OpenShift and Ansible are driven by high demand for these technologies; and fourth, we achieved strong renewals in our largest customers, including strong growth in the number of deals greater than $1 million as I noted earlier. Overall, we continued to experience strong demand across our broad portfolio of technologies.Now, let me describe a few business and technology highlights from the quarter. First, we announced the availability of OpenShift Container platform as a service broker that enables cloud native services from Amazon Web Services to be easily provisioned and managed on the platform including AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, and mobile application services. Originally, we announced at Red Hat Summit in May, this expanded alliance with AWS and provides customers with a unified view of their own applications and public cloud capabilities. We also made a number of other announcements related to the integration of additional Red Hat Technologies in the OpenShift platform.

                 'REG': 'It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Clark, Vice President, Capital Markets. Thank you. You may begin.Laura ClarkGood morning, and welcome to Regency’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Hap Stein, our Chairman and CEO; Lisa Palmer, our President and CFO; Mac Chandler, EVP of Investments; Jim Thompson, EVP of Operations; Mike Mas, Managing Director of Finance; and Chris Leavitt, SVP and Treasurer.I would like to begin by stating that we may discuss forward-looking statements on this call. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in forward-looking statements.On today’s call we will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and financial supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. Before turning the call over to Hap, I would like to thank those of you who participated in our Investor Perception Study. We are grateful for your candor and appreciate the feedback. Hap?Hap SteinThanks Laura. Good morning everyone. In our evolving business we continue to see the rise of retailers that have identified what it takes to remain relevant and evolved in the fall of those that have not. As we all know, Sears was once a successful brand, but in the ebb and flow of the retail industry their declining performance over the last decade, further hindered by excessive debt illustrates how critical it is for retailers to keep the pulse of consumer preferences and expectations. Sears failure, along with the success of numerous winning retailers also demonstrates the importance of having the capital to invest in the betterment of store, customer service and experience, as well as a technology platform that supports multi-channel retailing. The best in class retailers including Amazon, Whole Foods, Kroger, Target, Publix and TJX just to name a few continue to make sizeable investments in the bricks and mortar footprints. Based upon our many conversations that we’ve had with key retailers, it is clear the physical stores remain a very critical component of a multi-channel strategy. This is really apparent in how retailers are investing in the physical footprints and providing a seamless and differentiated shopping experience to meet the evolving needs of their customers. Kroger is not only enhancing their technology and delivery platform, but investing in their store with a restocked Kroger initiative, which focuses on customer experience, value and talent development. Safeway Albertsons while partnering with Instacart and rolling out Drive-up is also remerchandising 400 of their stores. Publix continues to heavily invest in both new and existing locations with plans to redevelop over 130 stores this year as part of their $1.5 billion capital plan. Publix has also demonstrated a real point of differentiation with their commitment to exceptional customer service. Going above and beyond offering aid in communities that were impacted by recent catastrophic storms is yet another example of the many ways that grocers are able to effectively connect to their shoppers and communities. Target has expressed their commitment to bricks and mortar and indicated that the store is the central part of their strategy. They plan to remodel all stores by 2020; continue to open their very successful small format store and are investing in their team, as well as pickup and delivery service. In addition, Amazon has announced an aggressive rollout of bricks and mortar locations and this is in addition to the large investment in Whole Foods. These and other best-in-class retailers are benefiting from the proactive investments and producing solid results. Publix reported strong comparable sales and generated an impressive nearly $1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. TJX’s comparable store sales rose 6% last quarter and Target reported their large quarterly sales growth in 13 years. Our well-conceived and well-merchandised shopping centers located in trade areas with substantial purchasing power appeal to these and other outstanding retailers and restaurants. Regency’s proven strategy which our team has successfully executed with astute capital allocation and intense asset management has been distinguished by sector leading NOI growth over the last six years. We do spend a significant amount of time ensuring that Regency is staying relevant and employing our unequal strategic advantages to achieve our objectives. First, earning a high quality portfolio that sustains sector leading same property in our growth; second, creating substantial value to our national development and redevelopment platform; third, maintaining a very conservative balance sheet; and fourth, engaging a team that is best in the shopping center business is guided by Regency’s special culture and operators efficiently with industry leading systems.

                 'REGN': "And now, I will turn the call over to Manisha Narasimhan, Head of Investor Relations.Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' third quarter 2018 conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our website under Events for 30 days. Joining me on the call today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Founding Scientist, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial (sic) [Financial] (00:56) Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.I would also like to remind you that remarks made on this call today include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, intellectual property, pending litigation, and competition. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, which was filed with the SEC earlier today.Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly, any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Thank you. Manisha does such a fabulous job at Investor Relations, we should at least get her name right. It's Manisha Narasimhan. Good morning to everyone who has joined the call. In the third quarter, Regeneron delivered record financial results, an important pipeline progress.EYLEA sales continue to grow. For the first time, U.S. EYLEA net quarterly sales surpassed $1 billion. Also, for the first time, third quarter worldwide Dupixent sales exceeded $0.25 billion. And Dupixent was recently approved for asthma, its second major indication. Additionally, we launched Libtayo, our first approved immuno-oncology therapy.For EYLEA, we significantly strengthened the franchise through a recently expanded label for less frequent dosing and the potential for a new indication in diabetic retinopathy. And we expect to advance a high-dose formulation of aflibercept into the clinic in the first half of next year.Libtayo, our first commercial entry into the exciting and fast-evolving area of immuno-oncology, is the foundation upon which we intend to build with multiple additional agents and approaches in many different cancer settings. We have described Dupixent as a pipeline and a product, and it is living up to that potential. Compared to other approved biologics for asthma, Dupixent has a differentiated profile and label.The recent asthma approval, together with the ongoing robust launch in atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and positive Phase 2 results in eosinophilic esophagitis, validate the scientific hypothesis that the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is responsible for a spectrum of allergic or Type 2 diseases. You'll hear more from Marion about the launch of Dupixent in asthma and atopic dermatitis, and George will update you on our clinical programs.We have continued to make steady progress with our other commercialized products. From Praluent, our LDL cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 antibody, we anticipate that the U.S. treatment guidelines for lipid lowering will be updated shortly. We hope the updated guidelines will facilitate greater access and support increased use of the PCSK9 class. Although it gets drowned out in the debate about drug prices, the fact remains that cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States, and high LDL cholesterol is a major cause of cardiovascular disease.Our early pipeline continues to progress. At the beginning of the year, we set a goal of advancing four to six new molecules into clinical development. I'm happy to report that to-date, we have already advanced four new molecules into clinical development. These include a bispecific antibody for ovarian cancer, a new antibody for pain, a leptin receptor agonist, and an antibody to CTLA4.We also expect to advance into the clinic by year-end, a BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma. We now have seven approved drugs and our clinical pipeline has 20 product candidates spanning a range of therapeutic areas. All of these molecules were discovered by our scientists. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.",
                 'RF': "I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.Dana Nolan Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome to Regions third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights about our financial performance, and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter.A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and earning supplement, are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call.With that, I will turn the call over to John.John Turner Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to take a moment to speak about Hurricane Michael. As we've seen, this was an incredibly powerful storm and communities in the Florida Panhandle, South Alabama and South Georgia all faced different challenges as they began the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of customers, fellow associates and the communities affected.As of today, all of our associates are safe and accounted for. All but five of our branches in the impacted areas are open and conducting business. And all our ATMs are now operating. We are working with our customers to determine their needs for assistance and have activated disaster recovery financial services, including ATM fee waivers and loan payment deferrals.I was in Panama City on Friday. And while the damage is significant, the markets are determined to come back strong. We're still evaluating the overall financial impact to Regions, but we do not expect it to be material.With respect to the third quarter, we are very pleased with our financial performance. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $354 million, reflecting an increase of 20% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we grew loans, fees and households, and delivered positive operating leverage and significantly improved efficiency.Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased again this quarter to its highest level in over a decade. It's important to point out that our results include the impact of a $60 million contribution to our Foundation during the quarter. Combined with the $40 million contribution we made in December of 2017, we've now invested $100 million, effectively positioning the Foundation to provide consistent and sustained investments in our communities for many years to come.Our third quarter performance clearly demonstrates our focus on continuous improvement is gaining traction. We remain committed to the successful execution of our Simplify and Grow strategic priority and investments in technology, process improvements and talent are paying off. In terms of the economic backdrop, we remain encouraged by current conditions and customer sentiment. Increased lending activity coupled with substantial completion of portfolio recycling and reshaping efforts allowed us to deliver broad-based loan growth this quarter.As we look to the fourth quarter, pipelines remain healthy and we're on track to achieve our low single-digit adjusted average loan growth for the year. Let me quickly remind you the four key strengths we believe provide considerable momentum for Regions. First is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage, driven by our low cost and loyal deposit base. This continues to provide significant franchise value and a competitive advantage, particularly in a rising rate environment.Second relates to asset quality. We believe the derisking and portfolio reshaping activities we have completed, combined with our sound risk management practices, have positioned us well for the next credit cycle.Third, our capital position supports credit growth and investments, as well as additional capital returns. And, finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance through our Simplify and Grow strategic priority, which is well underway. Again, our goal is to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance and we believe our results this quarter provide tangible evidence that our focus on continuous improvement is working.With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave.David Turner Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 4 with average loans. Adjusted average loans increased almost 2% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across consumer and business lending portfolios. New and renewed loan production remained solid, while previous headwinds associated with portfolio reshaping efforts subsided. In addition, recently implemented process redesign and improvement efforts focused on accelerating commercial credit decisioning, also led to loan growth. All three businesses within our corporate banking group, which includes corporate, middle market commercial and real estate experienced loan growth across our geographic markets.",
                 'RSG': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Giandinoto, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. The team sustained the momentum built in the first half of the year by capitalizing on strong solid waste trends to drive both price and underlying volume growth, advancing our multi-year initiatives to provide an improved customer experience, in addition to safer and more efficient operations, and executing our plans to mitigate recycling headwinds in the short-term and advance our long-term strategy to transform our recycling business.As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share, despite an $0.08 headwind from recycling, invested an additional $53 million in value-enhancing acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $133 million, and returned approximately $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.During the quarter, we continued to see solid revenue and EBITDA growth in our collection and disposal businesses, as well as energy services. Together, they contributed 80 basis points of margin expansion. The pricing environment continued to be favorable in the third quarter. Core price was 3.9% and increased 30 basis points from the second quarter.In the open market, core price increased 20 basis points sequentially to 4.6%. In the restricted market, core price increased 50 basis points sequentially to 2.8%. This is the highest restricted core price we've achieved in nearly 10 years.Improving the customer experience continues to be a critical part of our overall business strategy. We achieve this by developing and offering products that are designed to meet our customers' wants and needs and delivering superior service. Doing so helps us retain our customers for a longer period of time and earn a price increase each year.In turn, we successfully raised prices while maintaining our customer defection rate below 7% for a third consecutive quarter.Additionally, we continue to convert our CPI-based contracts to an alternative pricing mechanism. We now have 25% of our CPI-based contracts representing $625 million, transitioned to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI.We also continued to see strong underlying volume growth in our collection and disposal businesses in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, total volume increased 1% over the prior year. We believe the current economic backdrop, including solid consumer sentiment readings, supports continued top-line growth.",

Then I'll hand the call over to Brett Sandercock who'll walk you through our financial results in more detail.So first, our top level financial results. I'm really grateful to our global team for another quarter of very strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, 15% headline growth and 10% constant currency growth, led by sales in Europe and Asia; and then those combined regions we grew at 16%, 1-6, 16% in constant currency. Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America grew 7% overall in line with market growth.At the bottom line, we are continuing to drive operating leverage as we did in Q2. Adjusted net operating profit in Q3 grew 25% year-over-year which was an excellent result and the outcome of our global teams' hard work and operating excellence. This translated to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92. We are proud of this strong top line and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team.Now some business highlights, and let's start with Brightree. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% year-on-year. The Brightree team has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years and there's a stable record of success. To show Brightree's scale, here is an interesting metric. In the last 12 months, Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests. By quickly and accurately responding to these cloud-based requests, Brightree helps its usersreach more patients more efficiently, more effectively and more economically. In terms of next steps, Brightree is beta-testing with select customers an exciting, new analytics platform using data from algorithms that will generate actionable insights for customers to improve their business effectiveness and their patient care. We look forward to Brightree brining value to customers with this new data analytics offering in the very near future.For the longer term, we are very pleased to continue to have Raj Sodhi, the President of our software-as-a-service business focus not only on Brightree but also on new growth opportunities in the global out of hospital software market. Raj and his team are working to enable an ecosystem of connected software and human services to create a frictionless network for data and information to move across the healthcare value chain, so that as people progress through their personal healthcare journey, their medical data can seamlessly follow them.Brightree solutions were featured in the interoperability showcase at HIMSS that stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference. Brightree's participation in these demonstrations at HIMSS with over 7,000 visitors touring the interoperability showcase is just one example of our ResMed and Brightree commitment to connecting the post-acute care industry and patients to the rest of their care settings across that digital healthcare ecosystem. The response from current customers, prospects, and industry stakeholders at HIMSS has been very positive. We will continue to showcase the power of an interconnected out of hospital software platform to the rest of the industry.",
                 'RHI': 'Max MessmerThank you and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that comments made on today’s call contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions. We believe these remarks to be reasonable; however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today’s press release and in our SEC filings, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and today’s 8-K. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today’s call.For your information, our prepared remarks also are available on our website at roberthalf.com. From the home page, click on Investor Center at the bottom left of the page, you will find the Quarterly Conference Calls link in the Investor Center.Now, let’s review Robert Half’s financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Company-wide revenues were $1.466 billion. This is up 11% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year.Net income per share in the third quarter was $0.95, up 39% compared to the third quarter of 2017.Cash flow from operations was $185 million and capital expenditures were $10 million in the third quarter. We paid a $0.28 dividend to stockholders in September at a total cost of $34 million. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares in the third quarter, at a cost of $79 million. We have 9.1 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.All of our staffing divisions and Protiviti reported solid year-over-year revenue gains in the third quarter. Our permanent placement and Protiviti operations performed particularly well during the quarter.Skills shortages persist globally, driving heightened demand for skilled talent, especially in the professional-level segments in which Robert Half specializes. Also buoying our business is the sustained optimism among small and midsize companies, particularly in the United States, which is leading to increased hiring activity by this key client base.Return on invested capital for the company was 41% during the third quarter. I’ll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results.Keith WaddellThank you. As Max just noted, global revenues in the third quarter were $1.466 billion. This is up 11% from a year ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis.Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. These figures further are broken out by US and non-US operations. The term “as-adjusted” reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain inter-company adjustments in our international operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.Third quarter staffing revenues were up 10% on an as-adjusted basis, comprised of US staffing revenues of $920 million, up 7% on a same-day basis, and non-US staffing revenues of $293 million, up 18% on an as-adjusted basis. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.The third quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.1 days in the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter one year ago.Currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which reduced the year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8%.For Protiviti, third quarter global revenues were $253 million, with $200 million coming from business within the United States and $53 million from operations outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 18% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.Third quarter US Protiviti revenues were up 17% from last year on a same-day basis, while non-US revenues were up 20% on an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 81 locations in 25 countries.Now, let’s turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations during the third quarter was 37.8% of applicable revenues, compared to 37.2% of applicable revenues in the same period one year ago. Expanding bill/pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees offset larger fringe benefit costs.',

With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO.Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days.Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was a very good quarter for us. Organic growth was up almost 6%, above expectations. This included 10% Logix growth and 8% Process growth.From a vertical perspective, heavy industries performed well and grew above the company average in the quarter, led by growth in semiconductor, metals and chemicals. Consumer also grew above the company average, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Automotive was down about 10% in the quarter. Revenue associated with Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from The Connected Enterprise, once again, grew double-digits.Commenting on regional performance, the U.S., our largest market, grew over 6% organically. We saw very good growth in all industries except transportation. EMEA was up about 1% in the quarter. Good growth in consumer was partially offset by transportation weakness and we have not yet seen a pick-up in heavy industries in this region. Asia grew about 6%. China's sales were up double-digits. Latin America sales were up 11% and growth was broad-based.I'll make a few additional comments about our performance. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded over 1 point to 22.5%. Margins improved in both of our operating segments. Adjusted EPS was up 23% and free cash flow was again very strong. Patrick will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance in his remarks.Let's move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full year fiscal 2018. Global industrial production and other production indicators remain strong. We are experiencing growth across the regions and industries that we serve. Customers are asking for the value that the Connected Enterprise brings to them as they continue to drive productivity in their operations.Turning to guidance. Taking into consideration our year-to-date results of growing backlog and the macro outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2018 organic sales growth guidance to about 5.5% and continue to expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion. We expect that heavy industries will continue to be the largest growth driver followed by consumer. The tough comps for auto get easier for the balance of the fiscal year. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $8.10.I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q3 results and guidance in his remarks.Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the third quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good third quarter with reported sales up 6.2%. Organic growth of 5.7% was better than expected. Currency translation contributed 1.8 points of sales growth, a little less than expected given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.The fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 points. Segment operating margin was 22.5%, expanding 140 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth and good operating performance was partially offset by higher investment spending. Through three quarters, segment operating margin is up 150 basis points year-over-year.General corporate net expense of $28 million was up significantly compared to last year, mainly as a result of higher corporate development related expenses. Adjusted EPS of $2.16 was up 23% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of higher sales and strong operating margin performance. A lower tax rate and lower share count also contributed to the year-over-year adjusted EPS increase.",

Well, we're very pleased to report our 50th consecutive quarter of improved revenue in earnings. Revenues for the quarter grew 8.3% to $487.8 million, compared to $450.4 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.6% to $52.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share compared to $51.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.Revenues for the first nine months rose 9.3% to $1.376 billion, compared to $1.259 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 24.3% to approximately $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.83 compared to $105.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share for the same period last year.We expect good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter with the residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 5.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments.On August 10, we are privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, the 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The anniversary was significant in both a business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins and Lead Director Henry Tippie rang the closing bell and in doing so made history at the Exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only two directors present for our company's initial listing in its 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. We're fortunate to have their contribution and leadership for that period as well.As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as an exhibit in experienced square [ph] in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins Heritage Center such as our World War II era horse-drawn wagon and a bicycle that Orkin technicians used to provide service when gasoline was rationed.We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like Western, Waltham, Critter Control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we unveiled some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this suite [ph] at commercial iPad application.We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we've made over the past 50 years. Since acquiring Orkin in the 1964, we have grown from a few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company with more than 700 operations in 57 countries.In the early 90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry were, Rollins narrowed its focus on pest control and sold all of our non-pest control businesses. We then began to open new Orkin branches, created Orkin franchises both domestic and international and initiated an acquisitions strategy, all of which remains the same today.Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, Waltham and at 2008, HomeTeam Pest Defense which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we were able to grow and improve.",
                 'ROP': "I will now turn the call over to Zack Moxcey. Please go ahead.Zack MoxceyGood morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.Now, if you'll please turn to slide two; we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, and in our press release, and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.And now please turn to slide three; today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquire deferred revenue; a onetime debt extinguishment charge; and lastly, a measurement period adjustment to 2017 provisional income tax amounts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.And now if you'll please turn to slide four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?Neil HunnThanks, Zack and good morning everyone. Before going through today's agenda, we'd like to thank all of you who have reached out to express your support and concern for Brian, our Executive Chairman. On a personal note, I would like to thank Brian for his tremendous leadership and his long-term mentorship to me. I want to assure everyone it's business as usual here at the company which you'll see throughout today's presentation. We have a very deep and talented management team both in the field and here in Sarasota that is committed to the continued execution of our proven strategy.To that end, we recently promoted both, Rob Crisci, our CFO and John Stipancich, our General Counsel to Executive Vice President. These promotions are indicative of their past contributions to the enterprise and also their go-forward contributions to the team here at Roper. Our CIR based processes and disciplines are deeply embedded in our culture and we'll continue working to make Roper an even better company in the years to come.Now turning to today's agenda. We'll start with our Q3 enterprise results then turn to our segment performance and outlook followed by our guidance update and then we'll open up for questions.Next slide please. As we look at our Q3, 2018 enterprise highlights, it was really a fantastic quarter. Record results with revenue, EBITDA, net earnings, cash flow and virtually any financial category that you can look at.Revenue grew 13% to $1.32 billion with organic revenue growth of 9%. We saw double-digit revenue growth across all four segments, really just fantastic performance and very broad execution.Gross profit grew 14% with gross margins expanding 80 basis points to a record 63.8%. When you look at gross profit gross profit margins, it really highlights the power of our niche strategy and our team's ability to nimbly execute through the quarter.As we look at this margin, there was very little impact of tariffs or any cost push inflation that flowed through our numbers. It was really just spectacular performance across the board relative to our margins.EBITDA grew 16% to $473 million. EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points to 35.8%. Importantly, we saw double digit EBITDA growth and margin expansion across all four segments. Earnings before taxes, grew 18% to $411 million DEPS grew 31% to $3.09 and free cash flow grew 34% to $404 million or 31% of revenue.So as we look at the quarter, we're certainly delighted with the breadth of the performance, but also like the top to bottom leverage. You can see that revenue grew 13%; gross profit grew 14%; EBITDA plus 16%; earnings before taxes 18%; DEPS 31%; free cash flow 34%; leveraged all the way from the top to the bottom, really a fantastic result.Now I'll turn it over to Rob to take us through the income statement.Robert CrisciThank you, Neil. Good morning everyone. So, on the next slide, we have our Q3 income statement metrics, a little bit more detail on some of the numbers that Neil had outlined on the previous slide. On revenue, our results with a 13% overall growth and 9% organic growth, we exceeded importantly $1.3 billion in the quarter for the first time and we remain on track for double-digit revenue growth this year, our margins up, 80 basis points, our gross margins up 100 basis points, our EBITDA margin.",
                 'ROST': "Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the Company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the Company's fiscal 2017 Form 10-K and fiscal 2018 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.Barbara RentlerGood morning. Joining me on our call today are Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Group Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, VP Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.As noted in today's press release, both sales and earnings for the quarter were ahead of our forecast despite being up against very strong multiyear comparisons. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended November 3, 2018, were $0.91 up from $0.72 for the quarter ended October 28, 2017. Net earnings grew to $338 million, up from $274 million in the prior year. Our third quarter 2018 earnings results include a benefit from Tax Reform Legislation of approximately $0.16 per share. Sales of third quarter rose 7% to $3.5 billion with comparable store sales up 3% over the 13 weeks ended November 4, 2017. This compares to 4% gain in same-store sales for the prior year period ended October 28, 2017.The Midwest and Florida were the strongest regions for the quarter, while men's was the top performing merchandise category. Though above plan, operating margin of 12.4% for the third quarter was down from last year as higher merchandise margin was more than offset by planned increases in freight and this year's wage investments. For the first nine months, earnings per share were $3.06, up from $2.36 last year.Net earnings for $1.1 billion compared to $912 million in the prior year. The year-to-date earnings results include an approximate benefit of $0.51 per share from tax reform legislation. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.9 billion with comparable store sales up 3% over the 39 weeks ended November 4, 2017. This compares to 4% gain for the nine months ended October 28, 2017.As we enter the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 8% with average in store inventories up 9% compared to last year. As planned, store inventories increased due to the earlier Thanksgiving this year. Packaway as a percentage of total inventories was 41% compared to 46% last year. Similar to Ross, these discounts continue to post better than expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the period.Turning to our expansion program, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd’s DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our 2018 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,477 Ross and 235 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores for a net increase of 95 locations for fiscal 2018.Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on a third quarter results and details on our guides for the remainder of the year.Michael HartshornThank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin of 12.4% was down from last year, though better than forecast.Cost of goods sold for the quarter rose 60 basis points as a 20 basis point increase in merchandise margins was more than offset by 50 basis points of higher freight cost and increases of 15 basis points each from buying and distribution expenses. Occupancy costs were flat for the quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 30 basis points due to the previously mentioned wage investments. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $278 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 9.4 million shares for an aggregate price of $807 million. We remain on track to buyback a total of $1.075 billion in common stock during fiscal 2018.",
                 'RCL': "I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change.Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow up with a recap of our third quarter results. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment, provide guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018 and then close with some early thoughts on 2019. We will then open up the call for your questions.Richard?Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. After a rough week in the stock market, we're happy to share some good news. Our business remains healthy across our major source markets, and onboard spend continues to grow. We are particularly pleased to continue increasing our yield guidance which is now almost 100 basis points higher than our January estimate, and that's on a like-for-like basis. As a matter of fact, since our January guidance we have offset more than $115 million or $0.55 per share of headwinds from foreign exchange and fuel, and we still raised our guidance.I have to say that I am both frustrated and impressed – frustrated that we've had to overcome such headwinds and impressed that our fundamentals are so strong that we can face such hurdles and still exceed our forecasts.As it pertains to this past third quarter, we generated an adjusted EPS of $3.98, which was 14% higher than last year's figure. In fact, it's an all-time record. Given the concerns about weather, politics, trade wars and supply, this result definitely strengthens our confidence in the continued health of the cruise market. Part of the reason our business remains so strong is that we evolve our product to meet the evolving demands of our guests. The trend of people looking for experiences instead of buying things continues to be a defining characteristic. And it is a characteristic that we, at Royal Caribbean, pay close attention to. Fortunately, providing experiences and memories is already our sweet spot. Satisfying that new consumer preference is a constant focus of ours and one where we continue to innovate.In previous calls, you've heard me talk about our investments in Excalibur, our digital transformation platform. Today, I thought it would help to show you just how aggressively we are rolling out these capabilities to our guests. I would emphasize that our guest capabilities represent just one dimension of the program, but it's a highly visible one and I wanted to share it with you today.Slide 2 shows the planned launch schedule. The guest app in its current form includes features such as accelerated check-in, the daily planner, onboard accounts, shore excursions as well as the ability to book various items such as shore excursions, specialty restaurants and other onboard activities. You can see in the slide that we have highlighted three milestones that represent the way we make the app available to our guests. We call them crawl, walk, run.The first phase, crawl, refers to testing mode. In crawl mode, the app is up and running but we keep it very quiet so we can test it out with a small group of participants. When we are comfortable that the functionality has reached an acceptable level, we shift to the walk stage. When we get to walk, we allow everyone who wishes to do so to use the app, but we don't aggressively push it. This is roughly equivalent to the beta stage of most apps. It gives us a chance to test it under real-life conditions but only with a limited group of users. Lastly, when we get to the run phase, we want as many guests engaged as possible. The app is then available to anyone, and we vigorously publicize it so that as many guests as possible use it. When we get to the run stage, the app has been thoroughly vetted and most of our guests use it and love it.",
                 'SBAC': "I'll now turn the meeting over our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.Mark DeRussyThank you, Laurie. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us for SBA’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.Some of the information we’ll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2018 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detailed material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 5, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make.In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brendan.Brendan CavanaghThank you, Mark. Good evening.We had a great third quarter with very positive operating results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $435.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $430.2 million.Foreign exchange rates were weaker than our estimates for the third quarter which we previously provided with our second quarter earnings release, negatively impacting leasing revenue by $1.7 million.Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 5.9% over the third quarter of 2017, including the impact of 1.8% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 7.7%.Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 7% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis including 2% of churn. Approximately half of which was related to Metro, Leap and Clearwire terminations.Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth on a gross basis increased sequentially for the second quarter in a row, and we expect it to increase again next quarter based on a strong year-to-date operational, domestic leasing activity we have experienced. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 10.4%, including 80 basis points of churn or 11.2% on a gross basis.Gross organic growth in Brazil was 12.9% on a constant currency basis, a solid increase over the second quarter reflecting increased operational leasing activity in Brazil over the last 12 months. Domestic operational leasing activity representing new revenue signed up during the quarter was very strong in the third quarter up from second quarter levels and for the third quarter in a row, well above year-ago levels.During the third quarter, we again had solid contributions from each of the big four carriers. Newly signed up domestic leasing revenue came above 60% from amendments and 40% from new leases. And the big four carriers represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. WE have solid backlogs with each of our major U.S. customers and we expect them to remain active, investing in their networks, resulting in a continued healthy level of new lease and amendment signings in the fourth quarter.Internationally, we had another strong leasing quarter with Brazil providing the biggest contribution. In Brazil, we had solid contributions from Claro, Vivo, and TIM. During the third quarter, 86.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 11.6% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.3% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.With regard to third quarter churn, we continue to see churn from leases with Metro, Leap, and Clearwire consistent with our expectations. As of September 30, we have approximately $13 million of annual recurring run rate revenue from leases with Metro lease and Clearwire that we ultimately expect to churn off over the next two years.Domestic churn in the third quarter from all other tenants on an annual same-tower basis was 1.1%. And of that, less than 30 basis points was related to the big four tenants. We anticipate slightly higher churn in the fourth quarter due to the non-renewal of certain legacy iDEN related leases, the impact of which has been and continues to be included in our full year 2018 outlook.Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $344.8 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin increased to 82.8% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was a very strong 68.6% and 89.5% excluding the impact of pass through reimbursable expenses.",
                 'SLB': 'Simon FarrantGood morning. Good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today’s call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, Wells. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions.For today’s agenda, Simon will present comments on our third quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I would like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details on reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue.Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.Simon AyatThank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.46. Excluding charges and credits this represents an increase of $0.03 sequentially and an increase of $0.04 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or credits recorded in the current quarter. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily driven by strong international drilling activities. Pre-tax operating margins increased by 36 basis points to 13.5%.Highlights by quarter group were as follows. Third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily due to higher wireline and integrated services management activity in the international markets. This was partially offset by the completion of the first phase of an integrated production system project. Margin increased 88 basis points to 22.3% primarily driven by the increase in higher margin wireline activity. Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion increased 9% sequentially. This increase was driven by strong international growth and benefited in integrated drilling services. Drilling and measurements and MIs were core activities.Margins increased 103 basis points to 14% as profitability improved in certain IBS projects that started in the prior quarter. The overall increase in drilling activity also contributed to the margin improvement. Production revenue of $3.3 billion and margins of 9.8% were essentially flat. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was also flat sequentially. Increased sales in surface systems and drilling systems were offset by lower revenue in OneSubsea and valve and measurements. Margins declined 140 basis points to 11.4% primarily driven by the lower OneSubsea revenue. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was at 1.Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16.4% in the first quarter compared to 17.2% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. Our net debt slightly decreased during the quarter to $14.5 billion. We ended the quarter with total tax and investments of $2.9 billion. During the quarter we spent $100 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $64.98. Other significant liquidity events during the included CapEx of approximately $565 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $285 million. During the quarter we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2018 CapEx excluding SPM and multi-client investments are still expected to be approximately $2 billion.And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.Patrick SchornThank you, Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 2% sequentially with pretax operating income increasing 5%. In North America while we continue to gain market share in artificial lift and drilling, takeaway constraints in the Permian led to lower activity for our OneStim hydraulic fracturing business. Internationally, we continued to benefit from the broad based recovery that began in the second quarter seeing solid growth in all operating regions, driving international sequential revenue growth ahead of sequential growth in North America for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. As usual I will first discuss the revenue growth by geography without Cameron before concluding with a few remarks on Cameron’s third quarter performance.',

We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.",
                 'SEE': "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin, ma'am.Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in our earnings release. Included in the appendix of today's presentation, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we reference throughout the presentation.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.Thank you, Lori. Welcome to Sealed Air's third quarter conference call. First, I'll recap our third quarter results. Second, I will share actions we are taking to improve our performance. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our profitable growth strategy and how our focus on operational excellence will drive a step change in our future results.In the third quarter, net sales were $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA was $219 million and adjusted EPS was $0.61. We increased sales on a constant dollar basis by 8%, yet EBITDA was only up 4%. This lack of operating leverage was disappointing. As soon as we were aware of the shortfall, we wanted to be transparent which is why we pre-announced on October 17. Given our global footprint, we recognized we were facing unfavorable currency, higher input and freight costs and geographic challenges stemming from tariffs. Food Care managed through these headwinds in the quarter, while the impact on Product Care was more pronounced.Let me briefly unpack the quarter by division. We delivered a strong third quarter in Food Care despite currency headwinds and higher input and freight costs. Constant dollar sales were up 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 10%. Operating leverage improved sequentially, and it was encouraging to see some of the actions we took just last quarter had an impact on our results. There's still more work to do on productivity and efficiency in Food Care and that work is currently underway.Product Care on the other hand fell short of expectations. Constant dollar sales growth was up 12%, yet adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat compared to last year, and operating leverage was negative. We're not satisfied with this performance and we're addressing the issue head on. Global volumes were down 2% in the quarter with a 7% drop in our utility business. This business accounts for 30% of Product Care sales. Competition across our utility portfolio intensified in North America and the UK, and we experienced a slowdown in China due to tariff uncertainties. We're making process on upgrading many of our customers to more sustainable and automated solutions, but this shift is not happening fast enough.We're accelerating our actions in Product Care to take cost out of the business, while at the same time, strengthening our sustainability and automated solutions portfolio. The actions currently underway are being funded by our existing restructuring program. We expect our efforts to eliminate stranded costs from the Diversey sale to be largely complete by year-end, which is six months to nine months ahead of plan. This accelerated effort will result in $40 million of annualized savings realized in 2018 as compared to our prior expectation of $30 million. In 2019, we expect to realize another $25 million of annualized savings from these efforts. The projects remaining are being prioritized to address Product Care as quickly as possible.",
                 'SRE': "Good day and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Faisel Khan. Please go ahead, sir.Faisel H. Khan - Sempra EnergyHere in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 7, 2018, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra EnergyThanks, Faisel, and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was quite busy for us here at Sempra. We recently held a strategic update call where we discussed the announced InfraREIT and Sharyland transactions, and our renewable sales agreement with ConEd. This quarter's strong financial results add to this positive momentum. And together with this week's LNG announcements, further advances our strategic vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company.Today, we'll be providing more color on the progress we're making related to our disciplined phased approach to our strategic vision. Specifically, we'll be discussing how we're progressing. Cameron Phase 1, advancing our LNG development opportunities through this week's announced Heads of Agreements and memorandum of understanding, high-grading our portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet.But to be clear, we're committed to maximizing shareholder value through all these activities. We believe this can be achieved through our superior, projected earnings per share and dividend per share growth, coupled with our T&D risk profile. We'll continue to make disciplined investments tied directly to this strategy. I'd like to briefly discuss this construction progress at Cameron. The successful completion of this project remains a top priority. As we have stated all along, we continue to believe all three train will be producing LNG in 2019. We also remain confident in McDermott and Chiyoda's ability to deliver a state-of-the-art facility.Later in this presentation, Joe will provide some additional details regarding the commissioning of train 1 and other construction activities. In addition, we're working hard to make real progress on our LNG opportunities. Joe just spent two weeks in Asia and Carlos and I were in Europe meeting with our partners and potential customers. We received significant interest and hope to continue building our relationships in those two regions.Our recently-announced MOU and HOAs are a direct results of those marketing efforts. Please turn to the next slide. I'm pleased to say we continue to make great strides with our vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. An integral component of that vision is our commitment to continue to improve the visibility of our T&D earnings mix, which we are able to do through our recently-announced Texas acquisitions. These transactions require no incremental equity and we expect to fund them with a portion of the proceeds from our announced U.S. solar portfolio sale.Furthermore, we're continuing to make progress on the sale of our U.S. wind and certain U.S. midstream assets as originally announced in June. We're currently engaged in an active sales process with very strong initial market interest. Lastly, we're continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We plan to pay down parent debt with the portion of the proceeds from the announced asset sales and the settlements of our common equity forwards.And with that, I'll hand it off to Joe.Joseph A. Householder - Sempra EnergyThanks, Jeff. I'd like to highlight some of the recent projects we've captured that are incremental to our plan. I am particularly pleased with this week's announcements of the MOU with Total and the three HOA agreements for the ECA Phase 1 project. I'll discuss these in more detail in just a moment.Oncor is now projecting CapEx of approximately $10.5 billion over five years compared to the $8.4 billion over five years that we discussed at our analyst conference. The portion of this growth can be attributed to, number one, interconnecting the Rayburn County Electric Cooperative into ERCOT. Two, building approximately 30 130-kV transmission projects in 2019 and 2020, largely comprised of greenfield and brownfield lines. And third, adding two 345-kV projects in West Texas. They're part of a new transmission loop to support increased load growth in the Permian Basin. IEnova continues to expand its strong position in Mexico. Most recently, it announced the acquisition of a 51% equity interest in the Manzanillo marine terminal project. IEnova will build the terminal, which has a total estimated cost of approximately $200 million. The facility is expected to go into service in late 2020.",

Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1% in the quarter and revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606, which reclassifies certain advertising expenditures previously in SG&A as a reduction of revenue, decreased consolidated net sales approximately 0.8% in the quarter and nine months.Consolidated gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased $109 million or 5.7% to $2.01 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the third quarter was 42.5% compared to 42.2% in the same period last year.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $34.3 million or 2.6% to $1.27 billion in the third quarter and also decreased as a percent of sales to 26.9% from 29%.

We also incurred a pre-tax charge related to the California public nuisance litigation of $136.3 million or one-third of the amount of the abatement fund as recalculated by the trial court. I will provide an update on our lead pigment litigation in a moment.Including the litigation charge, consolidated profit before tax in the third quarter decreased $11.8 million or 2.8% to $416 million. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 14.9%, well below our anticipated rate due to the impact of share-based payments accounting standard, the litigation reserve and purchase accounting expense.Third quarter effective tax rate on adjusted income was 18.5% and we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate on a comparable basis to be in the range of 19% to 20%.Diluted net income per common share in the third quarter increased 11.7% to $3.72 per share from $3.33 per share. The current quarter includes charges for the California public nuisance litigation and acquisition-related costs of $1.09 and $0.87 per share respectively.The prior year third quarter includes acquisition-related costs of $1.42 per share. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted net income per common share increased 19.6% to $5.68 from $4.75. We have summarized the third quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2018 press release.Let me take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the third quarter increased $126.4 million or 5% to $2.67 billion. Currency translation decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.4 percentage points in the quarter. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.2% in the quarter.Sales growth was positive in all divisions in the quarter led by Southeastern division and followed in order by Southwest, Canada, Midwestern and Eastern divisions. Third quarter segment profit increased $52.2 million or 9.9% to $577.7 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit $7.5 million in the quarter. Third quarter segment operating margin was 21.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year's level of 20.7%.Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group, third quarter external net sales increased $47.2 million or 6.5% to $770.5 million. The revenue reclassification standard reduced net sales by 4.7%. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the third quarter increased $13.5 million or 19.2% to $83.9 million.Segment profit for the quarter includes a $26 million charge for purchase accounting expense compared to $54.6 million last year, and approximately $20 million in unanticipated supply chain costs required to keep pace with load-in of a new retail program while also supporting what is traditionally the peak architectural paint sales volume quarter in North America. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 10.9% from 9.7% last year.For our Performance Coatings Group, third quarter net sales increased $52.2 million or 4.2% to $1.29 billion.

Segment profit for the quarter includes a $55.5 million charge for purchase accounting compared to $102 million last year. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 8.1% from 4.8% last year.I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. On Monday, October 15, we were informed that the U.S. Supreme Court declined our petition for review. It is important to understand that this decision was not based on the merits of the case and we will continue to press our federal constitutional rights in other lawsuits as we continue to believe the California decision is an aberration.",

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.Good morning. We're pleased to report another record quarter with continued strong operating and financial results. Our investment in our product remains unabated with a long-term view of creating compelling integrated environments with critical mass that service the hub of retail, dining, entertainment and socializing within their communities. We completed several significant new developments and redevelopments in the quarter or under construction and others and announced more transformational mixed-use activity that will further enhance the value of our real estate and grow our cash flow.Turning to the results, highlighted FFO by $1.90 billion or $3.05 per share, an increase of 5.5% per share compared to the prior year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.1% or approximately $188 million to-date. Comp NOI increased 2.3% for the year-to-date period.Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent was $53.88, up 2.8% compared to last year. The Mall and Premium Outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.59 per square foot, an increase of 13.9%. We're pleased that retailer sales momentum continued in the third quarter.Our Mall and Premium Outlets was $650 compared to $622 in the prior year period per foot, an increase of 4.5%, and sales were strong across the portfolio in the third quarter. Retail sales productivity has increased each month over the last 12 consecutive months.Occupancy at the end of the quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 80 basis points for the second quarter and an increase of 20 basis points compared to prior years.On an NOI weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Retail sales would be $817 per foot compared to $650, occupancy would be 96.3% compared to 95.5% and average base minimum rent would be $71.21 compared to $53.88.At the end of September, we opened Denver Premium Outlet. Center is fully leased. It's off to great start. Center is another terrific asset within a great portfolio and a great location and a strong and growing market.Construction continues on two international outlets, expected to open in 2019, Queretaro, Mexico and Malaga, Spain. And we announced a 50-50 joint venture with Macerich to create Los Angeles Premium Outlets. This will be an exciting project on fantastic real estate and obviously one of the country's most attractive markets.Now at the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing across all of our platforms in the U.S. internationally, and internationally, we started construction on significant expansions of Paju Premium Outlets in Seoul and Tosu Premium Outlets in Japan.Last week, we held the ground-breaking of our landmark mixed-use transformation at Phipps Plaza that will include Atlanta's first Nobu Hotel and Restaurant, a Class A office building, a Life Time athletic resort, food hall and outdoor community gathering space, all in the area of one department store that we reclaimed.We also announced our transformational vision for Northgate in Seattle. We're thrilled to collaborate with NHL Seattle, make their training center and corporate headquarters, an enterable element of the re-imagined at Northgate Community. This project is a prime example of our unique ability to repurpose our well-located real estate, create compelling ways for consumers to live, work, play, stay, shop and now skate at our destination.Now, Sears, over the last several years, as you know, including what we just recently did at Phipps, we have reclaimed a number of our unproductive department stores in our portfolio. The reclamation of unproductive space, specifically some department stores, is an unprecedented opportunity for us to dramatically enhance the productivity of the space, our centers overall. And we will continue to proactively recapture additional stores to further enhance our centers.The SPG portfolio currently has 33 Sears stores that Sears has closed or announced they will be closed. Of those 33 stores, we have, through proactive action, controlled 22 of those 33, five of which are in our joint venture with Seritage. Of those 17 that we control, Sears will no longer exist in 2019. They will be demolished, replaced and redeveloped.Now, turning back to the 33 that Sears owns and controls, five that will be closing, and Seritage controls six for the total of 33, not including the ones in our joint venture. And they are – Seritage is the process of redeveloping those and are in construction – under construction with six of those former Sears stores. The remaining, we have 29 that are currently operating, eight are owned by us and leased to Sears, four owned by Seritage and leased to Sears, and 17 are owned by Sears.",
                 'SWKS': "Mitchell Haws Thank you, Kieran. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.In addition, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.Liam GriffinThanks, Mitch, and welcome everyone. The Skyworks team produced solid results once again in Q3. We generated a revenue of $894 million above consensus estimates. We expanded gross margin to 50.9%, up 20 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. We delivered record Q3 earnings per share of $1.64, $0.05 better than our guidance. And finally, we continue to deploy our cash to create shareholder value, returning nearly $300 million during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.From a market perspective, we are entering the seasonally strong second half while on track for another year of record financial performance. Based on our Q4 outlook, we will end the fiscal year with mid-single-digit revenue growth, greater than a 10% EPS increase and record cash returns. This despite a choppy market backdrop and a government imposed trade ban on a sizable Chinese customer.Our confidence is underpinned by our product expansion and reach, expanding premier mobile and broad market accounts. For example, during the quarter, we commenced production of access solution for Cisco, capture content and Linksys new dual-band mesh networks ramped connectivity engines for Amazon’s 4K Fire TV, a leading voice enabled streaming media platform. Partnered with Sierra Wireless on LTE CAT-12 data cards for M2M applications, deployed networking solutions supporting AT&T DirecTV gateway, extended our footprint across Nest home automation platforms. Enabled LTE telematics at TM and BMW and we introduced high precision GPS functionality, improving ride sharing, mobile payment and fleet management services. We also secured strategic flagship wins at Huawei, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, LG and Nokia. And then our infrastructure markets, we powered massive MIMO solutions for a leading European base stations supplier.In summary, we continue to expand the aperture of a design win pipeline spanning mobile, IoT, in a broadening set of diverse end markets. With IoT, the rapid proliferation of volumes represents a significant growth opportunity for Skyworks. Ericsson, for example, estimates that there will be 29 billion connected IoT devices by 2022. And at the same time 5G is upon us to dramatically higher speeds and lower latency enabled by 5G will catalyze a wide range of uses cases from the connected battery to the autonomous car to artificial intelligence. In order to make the leap to 5G system architectures require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure performance hurdles are overcome.Skyworks is leveraging our deep systems knowledge, strategic partnerships and formidable investments to accelerate the deployment of 5G with our Sky5 platform providing end-to-end performance across this critically important new spectrum. To that end, we reached key milestones this past quarter, including the launch of our Sky5 antenna tuning portfolio. Our newest 5G solutions deliver enhanced bandwidth coverage from 60 megahertz to 6 gigahertz. This is an enormous and incremental source of content growth for Skyworks as the number of antennas increased substantially across 5G engines.In addition, last quarter we successfully demonstrated our proprietary fully integrated Sky5 sub-6 gigahertz engines supporting new 5G and our radios across frequency bands and n77, n78 and n79. Quite simply Sky5 is enabling new 5G networks and facilitating ubiquities wireless connectivity for both people and things.I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter’s performance and our financial outlook.Kris SennesaelThanks, Lian. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 was $894 million, exceeding consensus estimates. Gross profit was $455 million with gross margin at 50.9%, up 20 basis points sequentially as well as year-over-year. Third quarter operating expenses were down sequentially to $130 million. As a result, we generated $325 million of operating income translating into an operating margin of 36.3%. Our tax rate was 8.9% in the quarter.Net income was $300 million, translating into $1.64 of diluted earnings per share exceeding our guidance by $0.05.",
                 'SLG': 'At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences to appear in the MDA section of the company’s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Also during today’s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures are most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company’s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company’s third quarter 2018 earnings.Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.Marc HollidayThank you everyone for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. We will discuss some of the highlights and accomplishments of the quarter as well as take as many questions as we can afterwards. But first, I want to put the quarter’s results into the context of the big picture. The engine behind our current strategic plan is the extraordinary value creation we have been able to generate in this current cycle, which really began after the ‘08-09 recession. As many of you know, we have been hard at work since 2016, finding ways to optimize and harvest the extraordinary gains in our portfolio as evidenced by over $8 billion of total gross transaction values, dispositions and recapitalizations, which resulted in well over $2 billion of cash inflows to the company since 2016. We have been very thoughtful and deliberate in redeploying these proceeds in ways we believe best benefit the company and our shareholders.Notably, we brought our aggregate and relative debt levels down considerably in this current cycle and we are also projecting to have record net cash balances on hand by year end. In addition and as you know, we have been moving along the path of being among the most aggressive REITs in the country in terms of share buybacks having bought back over 8 million shares and OP units year-to-date with the expectation and intent that we will round out our $2 billion share buyback program in the coming months. This continues to be an area of investment that we identified by far as the most attractive opportunity in our investment horizon right now and that opportunity has only increased with the recent sector performance resulting in FFO multiples for the company that I can only describe now is shockingly low.As we have reduced our leverage, shed non-core investments improved our asset quality and leased our portfolio, we have not withstanding seen our FFO multiple decreased to as low as 13 times, implying well in excess of a 6% capitalization rate on our prime New York City office portfolio and given the extraordinary quality of that portfolio and substantial discount in net asset value, we conclude that there is a dislocation that continues and warrants a continuation of our share buyback program. We have also kept our eye on the ball and make sure to take advantage of a number of limited strategic new investments in 2018 as and when we saw them arise. Most notably, 2 Herald Park and 245 Park are just two of the examples where we are able to put new money to work in ways that we feel will be highly accretive to the company and we do have a pipeline of additional opportunities that we hope to be able to expand on further at our December investor conference.As it relates to the positioning of the company for the future, we have ongoing and future development projects that we will be devoting our time and resources to in order to continue to maintain our standing as one of the leading real estate growth companies in terms of same-store NOI and FFO per share growth, metrics, which we again lead the office sector in 2018 and areas we will continue to try to demonstrate leadership in going forward. The development pipeline, which we will present in December in much more detail, will provide the new seeds of growth in 2020 and beyond as these projects begin to come to fruition irrespective of same-store rental levels between now and then, because these are all inventory right now out of any same-store metric that we follow, all of which will just be aggregate incremental NOI growth as these projects complete.',

Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials.We believe that our third quarter again demonstrated Snap-on’s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming period-to-period variation. We are encouraged by the results. Like every quarter, we had disparities from group-to-group and within each group.The van business appears to have stabilized with incremental improvement in organic sales trend, sales gains in the U.S. offset by decline in other geographies. Some segments saw a down period with challenges in our businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers and sales to OEM dealerships, but once again, our strength overcame.Organic sales in the quarter were up 0.6%. Sales gains in critical industries in the – in Asian Pacific, returned to growth in the U.S. van channel, progress in hand tools and power tools and the rise of software. That all combined to prevail against variations and move us forward again.OpCo operating margin of 19.3% was up from last year as adjusted by 70 basis points. Improved product mix across the group’s, net positive foreign currency and again the benefits of Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI, they showed the way.Financial services operating income was 59.3% – $59.3 million. That grew $3.3 million from last year’s $56 million. And that result combined with OpCo to raise our consolidated operating margins to 23.7%, up 90 basis points as adjusted. And excluding the one-time tax charge associated with the transition to the new U.S. tax legislation, adjusted EPS was $2.88, up 17.6%.Now let’s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. We did see mixed results from our businesses in that arena, but based on what we’ve been hearing from our franchisees, from technicians and from shop owners and managers, we believe the vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate and Snap-on, we believe we’re well-positioned to take advantage.For the critical industries, verticals like aviation, oil and gas, mining and heavy duty, we’re seeing significant progress, activity strong across – almost across the Board. We like the way the critical industries are sounding and trending. We had further advancements outside the U.S. Our Asia Pacific division registering solid increases in key countries like Japan and India and Indonesia.We do believe we’re well-positioned to confront the challenges and make progress along our runways for growth. But at the same time, it’s clear that we have great potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They are a constant driver of our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology.And in this quarter, Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation drove significant margin gain in the face of turbulence. And led – and besides that, it led to more prestigious product awards than we’ve ever had, more recognition than in any single year just this quarter.',
                 'SO': "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.Scott Gammill - The Southern Co.Thank you, Bridgette. Good morning, and welcome to The Southern Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in the Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as our slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss today will be viewed on the Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities as well as our competitive generation subsidiary, Southern Power, continued to perform well and we remain on track to deliver adjusted results that are well above our original expectations.While our financial performance this year is notable we are particularly proud of how our employees performed before, during and after the recent severe weather events. The resolve and professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than as demonstrated through recent restoration efforts in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, following Hurricane Michael. Hurricane Michael was the strongest hurricane ever to come ashore in Northwest Florida packing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, and a powerful 14-foot storm surge that left devastation across the panhandle of Florida.The destruction continued inland as Michael maintained Category 3 strength as it moved into Georgia and Alabama, another first-time event. Immediately following the storm, more than 600,000 customers were without power across our service territory. Storm restoration to customers of Alabama Power and Georgia Power was accomplished within three days of the storm. For Gulf Power, the effort included similar results for the service area which could be restored; however, much of their system around the Panama City area, had to be entirely rebuilt.This rebuild effort was accomplished within 13 days, some 30 hours ahead of the estimated time to complete. This extraordinary effort was not only a testament of the hard work and dedication of over 12,000 Southern Company personnel, but also included the critical contributions of over 35,000 personnel from 27 states and Canada who assisted with the restoration efforts. We owe these hardworking men and women a debt of gratitude for their commitment and personal sacrifice.The successful collaboration of our public and private partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy resulted in what we would consider an historic textbook restoration effort.Before I turn the call over to Drew for a review of our financial results, I'd like to first provide a few key updates. First, an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. On August 21, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted unanimously to approve Georgia Power's VCM 18 filing for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Subsequent to that approval, Georgia Power filed its 19 VCM report beginning a review process, which is expected to conclude in February of 2019. A full schedule for the VCM 19 proceedings is included in the appendix of the slide deck for this call.Additionally, on September 26, all four Vogtle project co-owners voted to continue construction on Units 3 and 4. This commitment means that we will continue forward with the construction of the project which is critical to Georgia's and our nation's energy future. While there have been and will be challenges, we remain committed to safely completing both units and maintaining constructive relationships with our partners along the way.Let's now move on to the progress at the site. The revised total project capital cost forecast including contingency communicated in the second quarter earnings call remains unchanged including no assignment of the contingency estimate. We have continued to firm up subcontract costs and now have executed contracts for approximately 95% of estimated subcontract cost compared to approximately two-thirds as of our last earnings call.Recall that the approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively. However, we continued to manage the site's planned work based on an accelerated completion date of April 2021 and April 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively, to preserve schedule margin.While some weekly results were impacted by Hurricane Florence and Michael, we have otherwise seen sustained improvement in productivity since the site stand-down and reset in late July. Since Bechtel became the primary construction contractor in October 2017, the cumulative schedule performance index and cost performance index are currently at 1.02 and 1.17, respectively.More recent weekly performance at the site resulted in SPI in-line with historical performance and a significant improvement in CPI compared to long term averages. We continue to view these two measures as the best indicators of performance at the site as they consider the collective impacts of productivity of the craft labor and staffing levels.Productivity is a key element of the project performance, in that it ultimately determines the number of resources that we will need to successfully complete the project.Focus at the site on key schedule drivers including the ramp-up of craft labor, productivity, system turnover and continuing to build upon the workable backlog to ensure maximum productivity. Most productivity improvements including weekly earned hours above 110,000 have come from the existing workforce. In fact, last week we achieved 120,000 earned hours, a new site record. This compares to approximately 80,000 weekly earned hours prior to the site's stand-down and reset this past July.",
                 'LUV': "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.Thank you, Abbey, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO.Before we get started, please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward-looking statements and our reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results, please visit our Investor Relations section of southwest.com, where you can find this morning's earnings release as well as our SEC filings.And now I will turn the call over to Gary.Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for an excellent third quarter performance. It was a very nice recovery from the second quarter, which was down 3% on a RASM basis due to Flight 1380. And then that was a nice turnaround to the third quarter RASM performance of – up 1.2%.Mexico was weak for us in terms of revenue. But our domestic performance, excluding all the international, the domestic performance was a solid RASM of plus 2.3% year-over-year. And it is 2.9% if you adjust for stage and gauge increases. Overall, we had a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement of 2 percentage points ahead of normal trends, so, again, it was a very nice recovery.Our year-over-year comps always have noise in them but I'm expecting another sequential trend improvement in fourth quarter and then a year-over-year improvement as we said in the press release of 1% to 2%. So, again, that would be another nice better than trend, sequential improvement if we do that. Our unit cost ex-items will come in roughly flat to up 1% for the year-end for the fourth quarter for that matter but another excellent cost performance. We wanted to provide you an early look ahead to 2019.Our confidence level forecasting revenues is never a 100%, of course, and especially looking a year out but our goal for next year right now is positive RASM and of at least 3%. And while it is a goal, trends and initiatives that we already have underway would support that goal.Our confidence level in predicting cost is much higher of course than revenues. And based on the planning that's currently underway, the preliminary read is that unit cost ex-items will also be up at least 3%. I'm not satisfied with that as I'm sure our investors aren't either and Tammy will describe the cost pressures further. But I did want to provide some perspective first.Just looking across the last decade plus, we've committed to strategic initiatives and invested accordingly. Some investments were revenue generating, some investments were capacity and growth related, some investments were efficiency related. But as a consequence of that strategy and those investments, the airline has been transformed and the cost during this intervening time period have been well controlled. And to do that, we've relied primarily on fleet modernization to accomplish that.We have a stronger, much more prosperous, but a more complex airline. In some cases, there are costs associated with driving these higher revenues. But the main point that I want to make is that our focus with our strategic efforts has clearly been on transforming the airline and driving more revenue along with operational reliability and customer service. I'm very pleased with the results of all those efforts. The results must be sustained and continuously improved from here.But eventually, I think all of us at Southwest knew that the time would come where our initiatives would need to zero in on efficiency and productivity and just overall cost control. And clearly that time has arrived and cost will be our number one priority. So the basic inflationary themes that Tammy is going to talk about we constantly battle. We're investing in airport infrastructure. We're investing in technology initiatives and projects. Aircraft maintenance is an ever-increasing burden. And then there is just natural salaries, wages and benefits inflation.So the opportunities to offset that natural inflation are what you would expect lies in modernizing our fleet, just overall quality of our flight schedule, continuing to drive operational efficiency, controlling our G&A spending. And then, from there of course we just rely on individual department missions.So for 2019, at this preliminary juncture while we're seeing the known cost pressures, we aren't yet seeing the productivity offsets. There are offsets in fuel because of fuel efficiency which of course aren't showing up in the cost ex-fuel items. But we're not seeing enough productivity offsets yet.So speaking plainly, it will take more focus on our part and more effort on our part to make that happen. And as I've already said that's where our focus will be and we may have to de-prioritize some other yearned for things that we have in the meantime.I'll also point out that many of our efficiencies are already underway. Again, we'll show up in jet fuel consumption. And we'll need to clearly identify that for you as offsets in the future. So we have a challenge. And we always do by the way. We always have challenges. We're very well prepared and very well positioned.Number one, we have a very strong balance sheet with declining leverage and it's below 30%. We have very strong liquidity with cash levels well ahead of our target. We just reported record earnings for the quarter. And barring the unforeseen, we expect very strong year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter. We have an outstanding fuel hedge that's built for the next 24 months. We have very manageable growth plans for 2019. And in fact we need growth to absorb investments that were made related to capacity like airports and training facilities.",
                 'SPGI': 'I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.Chip MerrittGood morning and thanks for joining us for S&P Global’s earnings call. Presenting on this morning’s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our third quarter 2018 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.In today’s earnings release and during the conference call, we’re providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation’s operating performance between periods, and to view the corporation’s business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contained exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.I would also like to call your attention to European Regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.We’re aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?Doug PetersonThank you, Chip. Good morning and welcome to today’s earnings call. The benefit of our diverse portfolio of exceptional businesses was evident this quarter, as we were able to overcome a decline in global bond issuance and delivered revenue growth, margin improvement and EPS gain. We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of long-term issuance remain strong, namely global GDP growth and a solid debt maturity pipeline. However, we have always cautioned that there will be months or quarters when issuance weakens enough to cause a decline in ratings revenue. It happened this quarter. The negative impact on issuance from U.S. tax reform, combined with economic uncertainty from Brexit trade negotiations, emerging market concerns and rising rates, resulted in a 7% decline in global issuance and a 5% decline in ratings revenue. Yet despite these headwinds, the company delivered great financial results.For me, the most important highlight from the quarter was the significant improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. This is a testament to the continued efforts across the company to emphasize top line growth, while installing lean processes and automation projects. We’re working to increase the level of financial discipline across the company and raise the technology acumen of every employee, not just software engineers, and this effort is paying off.In addition, Market Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices each achieved 10% revenue growth. Our revenue growth, margin improvement and lower rate from U.S. tax reform, combines to generate adjusted diluted EPS growth of 23%. We generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow year-to-date, excluding certain items, an increase of 24% over the first nine months of last year. The $1 billion ASR that we began in March was completed while – and we’re initiating a new $500 million ASR over the next few days that will be completed no later than early February of next year. Consistent with our return of capital philosophy, we expect to return $2.16 billion in 2018 through share repurchases and dividends.We’re particularly pleased that both Fitch and Moody’s upgraded our credit rating, recognizing the transformation that is taking place as a company over the past few years in the portfolio of businesses, improved profitability and increased cash flow generation. We continue to keep abreast of start-up activity in our space and invested $15 million in ESG and technology-related companies that I’ll cover with you in a moment.Turning to the third quarter financial results. Despite the decline in Ratings revenue, total revenue increased 2%, and adjusted operating profit increased 11%. This led to a 380 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin to 49.6%, our best quarter ever. These gains, combined with a lower tax rate from U.S. tax reform, generated adjusted diluted EPS growth of 23%.While the impact of U.S. tax reform has been positive for the company, it has, as we expected, been a drag on issuance. In fact, the 15 U.S. companies with the largest overseas cash balance as of the end of 2017 issued $126 billion of debt last year. Among those companies, Coke is the only issuer so far this year. They issued an $800 million bond in the second quarter. If this absence of activity persists in the fourth quarter, which we expect it will, these 15 companies alone will account for roughly 10% decline in U.S. corporate issuance this year. And of course, this trend extends beyond just these 15 companies.Global issuance decreased 7%, as the weakness in corporate issuance exceeded strength in the structured market. In the U.S., issuance declined 16% as investment grade decreased 24%, high yield declined 45%, public finance decreased 6% and structured finance is unchanged with declines in CMBS, offset by gains in ABS and CLOs.',
                 'SWK': "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Dennis Lange, you may begin.Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage.Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11:30 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our third quarter 2018 results and other various matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller.And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 1934 Act filing.I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.Okay. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.As you saw in our release, we delivered a strong third quarter in the face of some very difficult external headwinds. The company posted above-market organic revenue growth and 6% EPS expansion, overcoming approximately $135 million of currency commodity and tariff-related pressures.Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4%, with organic growth of 4% and acquisitions adding 2 points of growth, which was offset by a 2-point currency headwind. Tools & Storage was the vanguard, pressing ahead with all major geographies and business units, contributing to a robust 6% organic growth. Tools leveraged our strong portfolio of organic catalysts to deliver this above-market growth. Price added 1 point to the growth and realization expanded 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting benefit from our third quarter list price increases, and Don Allan will provide some more color on this in his remarks.Industrial delivered 10% total growth with the Nelson Fastener acquisition contributing 11 points, partially offset by 1 point of unfavorable currency. Organic growth was flat as solid performances within Engineered Fastening and hydraulics were offset by expected declines in Oil & Gas.Engineered Fastening delivered strong fastener penetration within automotive and industrial, which more than offset the expected volume declines in Engineered Fastening's automotive systems. It is important to note that that system's volume is highly correlated to new car platforms and 2018, as expected, has been unusually light for these platforms. With that being said, our win rate on new vehicle production lines is very high, so this weakness will take care of itself in 2019 and beyond.Security delivered total growth of 1% as bolt-on acquisitions and price offset currency and modest volume declines. The Security current team is fully engaged now in executing its transformational plan, and we are encouraged by the clarity of the vision and the sense of urgency. We believe we are making sustainable changes that will position this business for consistent revenue growth and margin expansion.EPS for the quarter was $2.08, up 6% as price, cost control and volume leverage offset the significant impact from commodity inflation, currency and tariffs.Consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy, we completed a $300 million share repurchase during the quarter and announced the IES attachments and MTD Products transactions. This reflects our balanced approach to capital deployment by executing strategic M&A opportunities, adding growth catalyst to the portfolio, while concurrently repurchasing shares.And as we look ahead to 2019, our view now contemplates a significant carryover impact from these external headwinds, including commodity inflation, currency and tariffs, as well as a somewhat slower U.S. residential housing and automotive markets related to continued upward pressure on U.S. short-term interest rates. And as such, we will be executing a cost reduction program to deliver approximately $250 million of pre-tax savings in 2019.Our seasoned, capable management team will continue to address these external issues with price recovery actions and adjustments to our supply chain. In addition, we believe these additional cost measures are required to preserve our ability to deliver respectable earnings growth and cash flow next year.",
                 'SBUX': "I would like to turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Roz Brewer, Group President, Americas and Chief Operating Officer; Belinda Wong, CEO, Starbucks China; and Scott Maw, CFO. For Q&A, we'll be joined by John Culver, Group President, International, Channel Development and Global Coffee and Tea; and Matt Ryan, Chief Marketing Officer.This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.GAAP results in fiscal 2018 include several items related to strategic actions including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, gains related to changes in ownership of international markets, and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well through August 25, 2018. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.Kevin Johnson - Starbucks Corp.Well, thank you, Tom, and good afternoon and welcome, everyone. On today's call, I will provide an overview of our financial performance in Q3, expand on the business update we provided last month, and reinforce our strategic priorities going forward. Then I'll turn the call over to Roz and Belinda to report on our Q3 operating performance in each of our two key markets, the U.S. and China, and update you on our plans for each market going forward. Scott will then take you through the Q3 financials in detail and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.Starbucks revenues in Q3 totaled a record $6.3 billion, up 11% over last year driven by consolidation of our East China business, strong performance from new stores, favorable FX, and comp sales increases of 1% both globally and in the U.S. Excluding FX and the net impact of streamlining activities, revenues were up 7%. June comps in the U.S. and Americas landed as expected, representing an acceleration from May and April. For the quarter our non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.62, inclusive of a $0.02 impact from the anti-bias training on May 29, representing a solid 13% increase over Q3 last year.While we fell short of the expectations we had entering the quarter, we made measurable progress against two commitments we've made to our shareholders: to deliver predictable, sustainable growth at scale and to create meaningful increases in shareholder value long into the future. To deliver on these commitments, we continue to focus our energy, capital, and resources on executing against our three strategic priorities.Our first strategic priority is to accelerate growth in our targeted long-term growth markets – China and the U.S. Our success in each market will be driven by further elevation and modernization of the third-place experience we deliver to our customers and continued expansion of our digital advantage. Roz will provide context around the progress we are making in the U.S. and a plan that is built with a clear understanding and focus on four evolving consumer trends. Consumers have increasingly ubiquitous digital lifestyles. Consumers want premium products, premium experiences, and value convenience. Consumers appreciate choice, including better for you food and beverage selections.Our innovation agenda in each of food and beverage, digital, and store design is being informed by each of these trends. And we are committed to increasing the velocity of innovation at Starbucks in each of these areas, as they are all key determinants of customer and brand relevance today. I remain extremely optimistic about the future of our U.S. business for several reasons. First, our beverage innovation platform is working and we have a full pipeline of new beverages on the horizon to delight our customers in the quarters ahead. Beverage innovation is fueling growth in our core platforms of coffee, tea and refreshers and offsetting some of the softness we've seen in blended.Second, our digital reach is expanding by every measure including a double-digit increase in active rewards membership year-over-year and the addition of 6 million digitally registered customers who are not yet rewards members but who have established a digital connection with Starbucks. And third, we have redoubled our efforts to drive disciplined operational excellence within our stores and to mindfully allocate capital with a sharp focus on managing our corporate expenses.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.Now, let me turn it over to Jay.Jay HooleyThanks Ilene, and good morning, everyone.As you've seen, we announced our third quarter financial results this morning. Our third quarter and year-to-date results reflect solid performance across our businesses as we continue to win new business and invest in the future, while reducing legacy costs as we advance our digital transformation.Despite a higher than average share count, third quarter earnings included substantial EPS growth and increased return on equity compared to 3Q 2017. Assets under custody and administration rose to record levels of $34 trillion, a 6% increase year-on-year driven by strength in equity markets and new business wins.We achieve new asset servicing mandates of approximately $300 billion during the quarter, driven by two substantial wins of approximately $90 billion each from the large European client and a top insurance and investment management company.Importantly, year-to-date we've now seen a number of sizable new client business wins, totaling $1.8 trillion and our new business pipeline opportunities remain robust across the franchise, giving us continued confidence about the differentiation in the marketplace from the service and solutions standpoint.Assets under management at State Street Global Advisors were at record levels of $2.8 trillion at the end of the third quarter, up 5% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting strength in equity markets and ETF inflows driven by the continued success of our low cost product launch late last year and institutional inflows.These positive growth trends within our core franchise were partially offset by market and industry headwinds, leading to overall fee revenue increasing only 2% year-over-year. I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive costs out of our core business and adapt quickly to the revenue environment we experienced this quarter. We actively brought down expenses for two successive quarters.Beacon continues to deliver significant savings and we have embarked on new productivity initiatives to achieve greater standardization and globalization of our operations and services. These levers equip us to achieve strong expense control as evidenced by the year-to-date increase in our pre-tax margins while continuing to invest for the future.More importantly, these initiatives enable us to create new data-oriented services and will provide the foundation for the integration of Charles River into the industry's first ever front to back office asset servicing platform from a single provider.Let me take a moment to update you on Charles River Development. As you know the acquisition closed October 1, integration is well underway and initial client reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Charles River is already creating opportunities among new and existing clients.We have our management team in place and are establishing a client advisory board anchored by OMERS. The Ontario Pension Fund, which is a broad based user of Charles River dating back 11 years. We're encouraged by the early reaction to the acquisition and are confident that will enable us to deepen and grow our client base, while delivering positive results for our shareholders.With that let me turn the call over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.Eric AboafThank you, Jay and good morning, everyone.Please turn to Slide 4, where you will find our quarterly results as well as a few notable items from prior quarters. As a reminder, 2Q 2018 include a repositioning charge of $77 million and 3Q 2017 included $26 million gain related to the sale of an equity trading platform, as well as 33 million in restructuring costs. I'll also remind you that 3Q 2018 results include the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This increased both fee and total expense by $70 million year-over-year but is EBIT neutral.Now let me move to Slide 5, where I will review the quarterly results as well as the year-to-date highlights. Third quarter 2018 EPS increased to a $1.87, up 13% relative to a year ago. ROE was 14%, up a full percentage point and pre-tax margin increased half a point as compared to prior year.3Q 2018 results reflect a disappointing fee revenue environment, largely offset by strength in net interest income and tighter expense control. We achieved positive operating leverage of 80 basis points compared to 3Q 2017. Fee operating leverage, however was negatively impacted by lower than expected fee revenue, which I will touch on shortly.Given the soft fee revenue environment, we intervened on expenses, excluding the impact from revenue recognition and the prior year restructuring charge, we held expense growth to just 1% as compared to last year.Sequentially, we actively flex expenses downwards. Last quarter I told you we would keep second half expenses flat to first half. In 3Q we did just that. Expense control is a key management priority as we navigate the quarterly revenue environment. We are carefully investing in product differentiation that continues to drive new business wins while reducing legacy costs.On a year-to-date basis, we delivered solid results. EPS increased 24% and ROE increased approximately two percentage points. We achieved positive operating leverage of 2.3 percentage points supported by positive momentum in NII and 4% year-to-date servicing fee growth.Pre-tax margin increased approximately 1.5 percentage points, further demonstrating our focus on managing expenses.Now, let me turn to Slide 6 to review AUCA and AUM performance, which increase on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. AUCA increased 6% from 3Q 2017 to 34 trillion. Growth was primarily driven by U.S. market appreciation and several large client installations, partially offset by the previously announced BlackRock transition.In Global Advisors or asset management business, AUM increased 5% from 3Q 2017, driven by strength in U.S. equity markets and new business from ETF mandate's, only partially offset by lower net flows within the institutional and cash segments.Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review 3Q 2018 fee revenue as compared to 3Q 2017. Total fee revenue increased 2%, reflecting higher equity markets and trading activity, as well as the benefit related to revenue recognition. Servicing fee revenue was lower compared to 3Q 2017, as well as compared to 2Q 2018, although it was up 4% on a year-to-date basis.",
                 'SYK': "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC.Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako and K2M. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.With organic sales growth of approximately 8%, our strong top line momentum continued in Q3, reflecting the strength of our diversified revenue model. Neurotechnology and Spine was once again the standout delivering 12% organic growth in the quarter as Neurotechnology grew 17%.MedSurg posted a 9% gain with Instruments leading the way. Orthopaedics increased approximately 5% powered by over 8% growth in Knees as Mako continues to gain traction. We are now approaching 600 robots globally and continue to feel bullish about the future of robotic-assisted surgery.On a geographic basis, sales were well-balanced in the developed markets and we grew double-digits in emerging markets. With cost transformation for growth initiatives continuing, operating margin increased roughly 50 basis points in the quarter despite significant acquisition-related dilution.With R&D at 6.7% of sales in Q3, we continue to focus on internal innovation, which is driving a steady cadence of new product launches. With the strong organic sales growth and operating margin expansion, we delivered adjusted per share earnings of $1.69 towards the high end of our targeted range of $1.65 to $1.70 for the quarter.Given our solid performance through the first three quarters of the year and our conviction in our Q4 outlook, we are raising our full year guidance for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS.With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on Mako with updates on the key metrics we have shared in recent quarters along with an update on our recently announced plans to acquire K2M. In the third quarter, we installed a total of 37 robots globally with 26 in the U.S. compared to a total of 33 in the year-ago quarter of which 23 were in the U.S.As expected, upgrades of robots in the field to the Total Knee application were largely completed in the third quarter. Over 50% of the robots installed in Q3 were in competitive accounts with Stryker either has no market share or share well below our average number. During Q3, roughly 145 surgeons were trained on the Total Knee bringing the total number of surgeons trained since launch to approximately 1,350.Looking at U.S. procedures in Q3, Mako Total Knee procedures approximated 11,300 bringing the year-to-date total to over 30,000 with all Mako procedures topping 18,700 in the quarter, Total Knees represent the majority of roughly 60%. Utilization rates also continue to increase, up about 40% year-over-year. We are also pleased with the increasing Mako Total Knee data supporting both the clinical and economic benefits.Specifically, a prospective study was recently published in The Bone & Joint Journal, which compared early postoperative functional outcomes and time to discharge between conventional jig-based Total Knee arthroplasty and Mako-assisted TKA. The study included 40 consecutive patients in each arm with all surgeries performed by a single surgeon.Overall, the study concluded that the Mako treated patients achieved statistically significant improvement with respect to decreased pain, improved early functional recovery and reduced time to hospital discharge compared with conventional knee surgery. And as it relates to hospital stay, patients treated with the Mako robot were discharged over one full day earlier than traditional knee surgery patient.Additionally, just this week, the Hip and Knee Society published a paper comparing 90-day episode of care cost with patients receiving a Mako Total Knee replacement versus conventional knee surgery. Overall, the study determined that Mako Total Knee patients episode of care cost were $2,391 less than conventional knee replacement. Additionally, index facility cost and length of stay were also less with Mako. And the Mako patients were discharged less the skilled nursing facilities and had a 90-day readmission reduction of 33%.All outcomes measured in the study were statistically significantly favorable to Mako-assisted knee replacement. Overall, we are pleased with the continued adoption of the Mako robot and it's clearly enabling us to drive meaningful knee market share. The early clinical data is encouraging and underscores the unique features and capabilities of the Mako robot that are enabling differentiated outcomes.",
                 'STI': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead, sir.Ankur VyasThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SunTrust Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com.Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.With that, let me now turn the call over to Bill.Bill RogersThanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the third quarter, which we highlight on slide 3. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.56, which represents a 47% year-over-year increase. Our strong credit quality, improved efficiency and solid loan growth were key drivers of the year-over-year improvement with continued benefit from a favorable operating environment, given both lower tax rates, including certain discrete benefits in the third quarter and higher interest rates.The culture of continuous improvement we've instilled across the company is reflected within the results. Our increased discipline on both expenses and returns continues to drive improvements in our profitability. I'll highlight some overall revenue trends. On the lending side, we had good growth in the third quarter with average loan balances up 1.8 billion or 1%, driven by growth across most categories. This is a reflection of the momentum we have with both wholesale and consumer clients, in addition to new lending capabilities we've added over the past few quarters.These levels of loan growth have outpaced our deposit growth, which in turn has driven increased usage of wholesale funding. While this is a positive for net interest income, our net interest margin declined 1 basis point this quarter, as we previewed a month ago. On the fee side, capital markets related income declined sequentially, largely due to the timing of certain deals, which were pushed in to the fourth quarter. That said, our performance in equity and M&A were strong as well as our progress on delivering capital market solutions to non-CIB clients, all of which continue to reflect our increased strategic relevance to clients.Our quarter ended strong and investment banking pipelines look very healthy, but I'm much more focused on our long term growth versus any one quarter. So overall, our revenue trends were somewhat mixed in the third quarter, I feel positive about the momentum we have going into the next quarter. More importantly, I feel even better about how we continue to work together as one team to deliver our full capabilities to our clients.This is simply how we win at SunTrust. Separately, credit quality continues to be a strength for us, not only because of the favorable operating environment, but also because of our disciplined risk culture. Our consistently lower charge-off ratio and improved outlook for credit losses across the portfolio drove a 4 basis point decline in our ALLL ratio.Our efficiency ratio remained stable, compared to the second quarter, despite the decline in fee income, due in part to our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management and also due to certain benefits realized in the third quarter. Again, our long term performance is much more important than our quarterly results and we remain highly focused on creating capacity to support our onboard investments and revenue growth and technology to better serve our clients, while also improving our efficiency.We have delivered consistently on these strategic imperatives. Lastly, we commenced our 2018 capital plan in the third quarter, executing 25% of our authorized $2 billion share repurchase program, helping reduce our share count by 4% compared to the prior year. Overall, our earnings performance year to date has been strong and bigger picture, I'm confident that 2018 will be the seventh consecutive year of higher earnings per share, improved efficiency and increased capital returns.This consistent track record continues to validate our improved execution, the strength and diversity of our franchise and our increased relevance with clients, which is in large part due to our ongoing investments in talent and technology.",
                 'SIVB': "Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.Meghan O'LearyThank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Dan Beck, are here to talk about our third quarter 2018 financial results and will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com. We'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We expect the call, including Q&A, to last approximately an hour.And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.Greg BeckerThank you, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our third quarter was an outstanding one with continued strong performance across the business. We delivered earnings per share of $5.10 and net income of $275 million. Our results were driven by robust client liquidity, healthy balance sheet, exceptional gains on warrants and VC related investments, strong core fee income and stable credit quality.A few highlights from the third quarter compared to the second quarter, average total client funds increased by 8% to $128.7 billion, average loans grew by 6% to $26.3 billion, net interest income increased by 6% to $496 million, core fee income increased by 7% to $132 million and we had gains from equity warrants and venture capital related investments totaling $60 million. We also delivered a return on equity of 22.5% and an efficiency ratio of 44%.It was truly was an outstanding quarter in our outstanding year-to-date. Based on our outperformance, we are again raising our full year 2018 outlook for revenue and balance sheet growth. In addition, we’re introducing our preliminary outlook for 2019, which shows healthy growth of an already strong year. The most significant trend of the year and a major contributor to our strong performance has been the high levels of liquidity available to our clients and in the markets overall. Venture capital and private equity investments are to near record levels, fund raising remains strong with a lot of dry powder on the sidelines and the ex-environment is relatively healthy.At $84.3 year-to-date, U.S. venture capital investment has already exceeded 2017 levels and is approaching all time highs. U.S. VCs have raised $32 billion, putting 2018 on pace to exceed 2017 and marks the fifth consecutive year of fund raising in excess of $30 billion. The expansion of global private equity industry has been dramatic and sustained. In Q3, there were more than 3,000 private equity funds raising capital, a 52% increase over a year ago, and dry power reached a record high of $1.1 trillion.While tech IPOs has not regained their strength, the IPO market overall has shown some notable improvements over last year. The number of IPOs year-to-date has already surpassed 2017 and this is the best third quarter for IPO since 2014. IPOs among the life science companies have been particularly strong of numbering tech IPOs two to one so far this year. On the tech side, the number of IPOs has still increased, but is being impacted by the liquidity available to later stage private companies.This strong momentum in venture capital and strength in the broader private equity markets is evidenced across our business as our ability to execute consistently. Our client win rate remains very strong with more than 1,200 new core commercial clients added in the third quarter. Private equity team delivered one of the strongest growth quarters ever and reached all time highs for loans and deposits on both average and a period end basis. Our life sciences team is growing loans at 36% on an annualized rate and has generated $10 billion of client funds growth in the past twelve months.Our private bank team is delivering loan growth at a 22% annualized rate and that rate has increased every quarter for the past year, thanks to investments in infrastructure, marketing and people. Our international team is also growing its balance sheet and revenues at a rapid pace and we continue to expand that business. In May, we opened our Frankfurt office and have been generating new business and seeing momentum there. And in September, our China joint venture opened a new office in Shenzhen, which is home to a booming innovation community and some of China's biggest tech companies.Finally, despite the pressure from competition and liquidity in the markets, particularly on the technology lending, SVB continues to be a partner of choice for the innovation community in part because we support our clients in ways that go far beyond lending. We believe our holistic focus on our client success will continue to be a winning strategy in the long-term. Even with our thriving markets and prospering clients, the current market still holds challenges. From an industry perspective, competition from banks and non-banks continues to press balance sheet growth, product pricing and this extends to hiring and retaining the best people.",
                 'SYMC': "Thank you. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Cynthia Hiponia. Ma'am?Cynthia HiponiaGood afternoon. This is Cynthia Hiponia, Vice President of Investor Relations at Symantec and I am pleased to welcome you to our call to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings results.

We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below.Our management team uses this non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and annualizing future periods.

Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information.You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.And now, I would like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark.Greg ClarkThank you for joining us and good afternoon. We are disappointed that we missed our total company revenue guidance for Q3 despite what we feel was an otherwise good quarter for our business. Our Consumer Digital Safety segment achieved the high-end of our revenue guidance for the quarter. Our Enterprise segment, on the other hand, recognized less revenue than we forecast, despite selling and invoicing more business than we planned. This was due to an increasing mix shift towards our ratable, subscription and cloud-delivered products that reduced in-period revenue recognition. Most of my prepared remarks will focus on our Enterprise segment.As we have discussed on prior calls, to grow our Enterprise business, since the combination of Symantec and Blue Coat, we have focused on building our Enterprise sales force team, who in turn create the pipeline to grow the business. We had the right level of capacity and selling activity from our Enterprise sales force in Q3, but we did not correctly forecast the perpetual product and license versus ratable mix, which resulted in lower in-period revenue and a larger increase in our deferred revenue balance.Our customers are purchasing our ratable products much more frequently than we anticipated in our plans in FY 2018. We now expect this ratable, mix shift trend to continue to a point where traditional license and appliance product sales become the exception in our business. As our cloud and subscription solutions have reached parity with our traditional appliance products, our customers are adopting our ratable solution at an increasing pace due to their evolving buying preference for cloud and subscription form factors and differentiation from our solutions. Our Enterprise strategy always embraced this shift in both our selling motion and our product roadmaps, but the pace of this transition has far exceeded our expectations.We are winning the volume of business that we expected, as is represented by our implied billings growth, which is up 27% year-over-year for Enterprise in the third quarter, as adjusted for the divestiture of our Certificate Authority business. However, the shift towards a ratable revenue mix is a significant trend for us and will continue. As a result, we are reducing our Q4 and FY 2018 Enterprise revenue guidance to incorporate a higher ratable mix for our Enterprise business going forward and we will be providing expectations for implied billings in Q4.",

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.Margaret KeaneThanks, Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide three. Our performance were strong across several key business drivers in the third quarter, broad based growth helps drives earnings of $671 million or $0.91 per share.Loan receivables grew 14% and we generated strong net interest income growth of 9%. Purchase volume increased 11% and average active accounts were up 9%. As you know, we completed our acquisition of the PayPal Credit program in the third quarter and that is now included in our results. Brian will discuss some of the associated impacts later in the call.We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and added some exciting new partnerships. In our Retail Card sales platform, we extended our strategic partnership with Lowe, building on a nearly four decade long relationship. As part of this extension, we will continue to manage and service both their consumer and commercial credit card programs.A key focus for the program is making the consumer experience even easier by further advancing technological capabilities to enhance the digital experience for Lowe's customer, tapping the power of mobile for areas such as payments and applications. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Lowe's, to help them grow sales and enhance their customers' experience.We are also very pleased to renew our partnership with JCPenney. This nearly two decade long partnership has been very successful with high engagement. Working together we have leveraged data analytics to uncover new customer insights, further personalizing the customer experience.We have also helped JCPenney integrate credit payments into their mobile app. The deep collaboration between us has already proven to benefit customers across all shopping channels and we will continue to leverage advance data analytics to help drive even better experiences for card holders. We have been able to add significant value to the program in a dynamic market environment and look forward to continuing the strategic partnership with JCPenney.In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we renewed key relationships with Associated Materials, a leading manufacturer and distributor of exterior residential building products and Generac, a leading supplier of backup power and prime power products systems and engine power tools. We also signed some exciting new programs during the quarter.In Payment Solutions we added a new partnership with Fred Myers Jewelers, a national jewelry chain and in CareCredit we added a new partnership with Eargo a hearing aid manufacturer. Over the past several quarters we have broaden the scope of our valuable CareCredit network adding more than 25 new specialties where the card is accepted.Our focus on expanding CareCredit's utility has led to the acceptance of the card in medical specialties including primary care and general practice, physical therapy, ambulatory surgery, durable medical equipment and urgent care. The Care credit card can be used for deductibles, co-pays, planned medical procedures, annual wellness visits, imaging and other out of pocket costs.As you know expanding acceptance in utility of the successful card and network has been a key objective for us as we strive to move these cards to the top of the cardholders' wallet, migrating towards more repeat purchase behavior. To that end, we have made substantial progress in improving the usage of our cards as evidenced by our reuse rates. For CareCredit the reuse rate in the third quarter was 53% and for Payment Solutions it was 29% of total purchase volume.",
                 'SNPS': 'At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Lisa EwbankThanks, Ana. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today’s earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentations, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.Aart de GeusGood afternoon. I’m happy to report that Synopsys delivered another outstanding quarter and passed the $3 billion mark in trailing 12-month revenue. An exciting milestone as we enter our next phase of growth, and it’s a good time to think our Synopsys team, our customers, our partners and all of you for your support.We entered fiscal 2018 with expectations for solid revenue, earnings and cash flow. As a result of strong customer demand and excellent execution, we’re on track to substantially exceed the targets we communicated last November and expect to deliver double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the year.For Q3, we posted revenue of $780 million, with strength across all product groups; non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.95, and we generated $289 million in operating cash flow. We repurchased $165 million of our stock, bringing the total for the year to $400 million.Lastly, we’re raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Trac will provide more detail in a moment. The customer environment is strong, as the age of AI, or digital intelligence, drives hefty investments by traditional and new semiconductor and systems companies, as well as software developers across many industries.Investments are directed at supplying the increasing demand for compute power, cloud storage, and networking infrastructure, all in support of massive data and complex software. Add to that the huge and growing challenge of security, and one can readily see that the need for design solutions will continue to expand for years to come.Synopsys is uniquely positioned to address these technological challenges, sitting at the intersection of hardware and software. As a result, we’ve grown and strengthened our leadership position in EDA, built a strong and broad IP business group, and branched out into the large, adjacent TAM of software security and quality.In this context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. The primary driver of EDA growth is complexity. Whether due to more advanced process technologies, sophisticated designs at established nodes, or immense amounts of software embedded on a chip. In our entire history, leadership in electronic complexity has been the differentiator for the Synopsys solutions. Today, this means moving to 7, 5, or even 3-nanometer process technologies.With our TCAD and lithography tools, we’re a key partner in the initial stages of manufacturing process development. These early engagements benefit all subsequent products, as demonstrated by some of the successes in the quarter. We announced broad certification for several Samsung Foundry advanced processes, from digital and custom design to verification.And just last week, we announced a collaboration with IBM to enable their very advanced process development with our manufacturing, digital design and IP capabilities.Our design platform generated revenue greater than plan, reaching an all-time high, with accelerating growth over the past year. On the digital side, our recently introduced Fusion Technology, which brings about a revolutionary new level of integration between synthesis, place & route, and signoff, is really hitting the mark with customers.Not only does the Fusion Technology provide a fundamental infrastructure to design better chips, but we’ve already embedded a number of AI techniques that further improve speed, area and power. Engagements with partners and customers have grown. Samsung Foundry has certified our Fusion Technology for its 7-nanometer Low Power Plus process with EUV.',
                 'SYY': "Please go ahead.Neil Russell Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me in Houston today are Tom Bené, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the Company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner.Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2017; subsequent SEC filings; and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco's IR app.Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website.To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Bené.Tom Bené Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to start the company’s key themes that drove our results for the quarter along with some comments on the current macroenvironment that we are operating in, followed by a discussion of our U.S. Food Service Operations business and concluding with the discussion of our International and other business segments. Joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail. This quarter, we were able to deliver solid results that include adjusted operating income growth of 7.1% compared to the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. There were number of key business drivers that impacted the results for the quarter including strong gross profit dollar growth, despite adverse weather in multiple geographies and continued investments that we are making across our business.Turning to the macro environments, the overall trends continue to be generally favorable in the United States. This led to improved spend for the Retail and Food Services sectors and somewhat favorable conditions for Food Service operators as sales at restaurants continue to rise offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts.We also see continued growth with local customers as they increased their reach through innovative concepts and additional delivery methods. Economic growth in the International markets in which we operate was mostly positive including modest growth in the Food Service sector. Looking at our results, sales grew 6.1% to $14.3 billion driven by strong performance from our local customers, the addition of new customers accelerating our national customer growth, product cost inflation and an acquisition. As we shared during our Investor Day, we are focused on M&A activity as a part of our strategy and have recently closed three acquisitions, HFM in Hawaii, Kent Frozen Food in the UK, and Doerle Food Service in Louisiana. We are excited about all three companies and the talented associates that we are bringing into the Sysco family. However, only the results of HFM are included in our third quarter results. Gross profit grew 5.6% driven by positive case growth and effective ongoing management of product cost inflation. While we continue to face some challenges from inbound freight cost, the trend has been somewhat improving and was less of an impact in the third quarter. Additionally, the growth of Sysco brand, which now comprises nearly 46% of local cases resulted in incremental gross profit dollars. Sysco brand continues to be driven by customers’ interest and our growing breadth of products offered across multiple categories and tiers along with continued progress from our brand revitalization efforts and new innovative products from our cutting-edge solutions process.From an expense perspective, adjusted operating expense for the quarter grew 5.2% driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business and a few operational challenges that impacted the quarter. Some of those investments include supply chain transformation work occurring in Europe, the investment in marketing associates in the U.S., and the continued investments in technology that will ultimately translate into a more enriching experience for our customers. One example is the investment we are making in Sysco Labs. Our Sysco Labs teams, in conjunction with our business technology team, continue to enhance our technology offerings to customers including further enhancements to support the ordering process and how customers receive products from us, all intended to make it easier for customers to do business with us.

                 'TPR': "Andrea ResnickGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our quarterly results and annual forecast are Victor Luis, Tapestry's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Willis, Tapestry's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are built upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations, based upon a number of important factors, including risks and uncertainties, such as our ability to achieve intended benefits, cost savings and synergies from acquisitions, expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, control cost, successfully execute our operational efficiency initiatives and growth strategies and the impact of tax reform legislation. Please refer to our latest quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our annual report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a complete list of risks and important factors. Please note that historical trends may not be indicative of future performance.Also certain financial information and metrics that will be discussed today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items related to our operational efficiency plan, integration and acquisition-related charges and the impact of tax reform legislation as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuation were noted. You may identify these non-GAAP measures by the terms non-GAAP or constant currency. The company believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful for investors and others to evaluate the company's ongoing operations and financial results against historical performance and in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of the business. You may the corresponding GAAP financial information or metric as well as the related reconciliation on our website, www.tapestry.com/investors, and then viewing the earnings release posted today. Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Victor Luis will provide an overall summary of our third fiscal quarter 2018 results for our 3 brands. Kevin Willis will continue with details on financial and operational results and our outlook for the balance of FY '18. Following that, we will hold the question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Josh Schulman, Chief Executive Officer and Brand President of Coach; and Todd Kahn, Tapestry's President and Chief Administrative Officer. This Q&A session will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. We will then conclude with some brief summary remarks. I'd now like to introduce Victor Luis, Tapestry's CEO.Victor LuisGood morning. Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. We are delighted to report a solid third quarter, which met our overall expectations from both a top line and bottom line perspective as we drove double-digit gains in sales, operating income and EPS on a non-GAAP basis, leveraging the benefits of Tapestry's multi-brand global model. As noted in our press release this morning, our results benefited from strong organic sales growth at Coach as well as the contribution of Kate Spade, which more than offset from execution issues and cost headwinds at Stuart Weitzman. Naturally, we were excited to drive continued positive global comps for Coach with outperformance in North America driven by our strong product offering and the successful global relaunch of Signature in retail. We were also pleased to deliver a better-than-expected consolidated operating margin, reflecting overall tight expense control, which Kevin will review in more detail shortly.The Kate Spade integration into our operating platform continued smoothly during the quarter as we executed on the strategic actions to position the brand for long-term success. These included the pullback on flash sales and wholesale disposition while taking substantial steps to unlock cost and operating synergies. We remain especially excited about the opportunities for the brand, both in terms of revenue growth, driven by distribution expansion and productivity, and profitability improvements as we leverage our scale across our supply chain and corporate functions. We now expect to achieve synergies in the area of $45 million in FY '18, primarily related to SG&A as well as earlier-than-expected realization of COGS benefits. We are continuing to target run rate synergies from both COGS and SG&A of approximately $100 million to $115 million in fiscal 2019. Over the last few months, we also made several key hires across our brands. At Kate Spade, we announced Anna Bakst as CEO and Brand President. She brings a rare combination of business acumen, directly related fashion experience and strong leadership skills to the company. Together with the recently appointed Creative Director, Nicola Glass, we now have the right senior management in place to lead the talented Kate Spade team and drive the business globally. At Stuart Weitzman, we're excited about the appointment of Eraldo Poletto, who just joined us as CEO and Brand President. He brings 30 years of fashion experience and a proven track record in driving luxury brand growth globally. ",
                 'TGT': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.John HulbertGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; Mark Tritton, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Cathy Smith, Chief Financial Officer.In a few moments, Brian, John, Mark and Cathy will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance, outlook for the fourth quarter and progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.This morning, we are joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Cathy and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond. Brian?Brian CornellThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are the result of superb execution by our team as they continue to drive outstanding near-term performance. In addition, the team is fully engaged in making meaningful progress as they work to transform Target and position us for sustainable long-term success.Third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.09 was in line with our expectations and more than 20% higher than last year. This performance also established a new all-time high for Target’s third quarter adjusted EPS. Our third quarter comparable sales increase of 5.1% was also in line with our expectations and slightly stronger than the pace we established in the first half of the year. This comp growth is very encouraging on its own, but we're even more excited that it's being driven by traffic in both our stores and digital channels.Comparable sales in our digital channels grew 49% in the third quarter, far outpacing the industry and the vast majority of our peers. This growth was driven by our guest response to our team’s efforts to make the digital shopping experience easy and seamless, deliver new and innovative items through our owned, exclusive and national brand assortments and offer an unmatched suite of convenient fulfillment options.While digital channel sales continued to grow rapidly, we are benefiting from healthy traffic and sales growth in our stores as well. This growth reflects the capital we are investing in our remodel program, enhancements of the assortment and presentation in key categories, and investments in our team, which will help them provide an elevated experience and higher level of service.And finally, on top of comparable sales, new stores contributed more than 0.5 percentage point to our third quarter sales growth. This growth is being driven by new small format locations that we're opening in dense urban settings and near college campuses across the country. We refer to these stores as small because of their square footage, but they really punched above their weight because of their high sales productivity. This allows these locations to deliver strong financial returns while allowing Target to reach guest segments we couldn't serve in the past.As we've been saying all year, when we analyze the drivers of our strong traffic and sales growth, we see the benefit of all the strategic initiatives we are pursuing, including our remodel program, efforts to rejuvenate our portfolio of owned and exclusive brands, the rollout of new fulfillment options focused on delivering ease and convenience, including Restock, Drive-Up, and Personal Shopping in as little as two hours with Shipt; investments that allow our stores to fulfill an increasing number of target.com shipments, allowing us to deliver quickly, while also controlling costs; new digital capabilities to make shopping faster, easier, and more inspiring; our work to ensure we are priced right daily while delivering the appropriate number of clear, compelling promotions; and investments in hours, wages and training for our team to further differentiate the shopping experience in our stores. Rather than measuring a separate benefit from each of these efforts, we believe the impact of all of them together is well beyond the sum of the parts.From a guest perspective, it's the combination of everything we are doing that makes Target more top of mind, causing guests to choose us more often. Beyond the impact of our efforts, we continue to benefit from a very healthy consumer and macroeconomic backdrop.In addition, as other retailers continue to close stores and liquidate in the face of rapid changes in consumer preferences and shopping behaviors, our investment position Target to capture sales and market share by serving consumers who are no longer shopping those competitors.",
                 'TEL': "I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter 2018 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we'll be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.Finally, due to the increasing number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions during the allotted time. We're happy to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue and ask second question.Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence, for opening comments.Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our third quarter results and updated outlook for 2018. Before I get into the earnings slides, let me briefly recap our quarterly results and full year guide against the elements of our strategy and business model.Our results in the quarter demonstrate successful executions, with ongoing investments to support an attractive and growing demand pipeline and another quarter of growth above markets in which we serve. On the top line, we delivered 6% organic growth in the third quarter and we also expect 6% organic growth at our midpoint for the full year and this is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% long-term organic growth target.Our revenue growth continues to be driven by secular trends and our focus on co-creating with our customers by leveraging our leading global position in this increasingly connected world and this is enabling TE to consistently outgrow our end markets.On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% and we're raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance which also reflects 15% growth over the prior year. This growth is consistent with our annual double-digit earnings growth target and our business model. From a capital perspective, our strategy remains balanced through share buybacks, dividends, as well as a disciplined approach on acquisitions, and we continue to invest to support the organic growth opportunities in our business while maintaining ROIC levels in the mid-teens.So if you could, let's move to the slides, and I'll start with slide 3 to review the highlights from our third quarter. We did deliver performance above our guidance with double-digit growth in revenue as well as adjusted earnings per share. Sales were $3.8 billion representing 12% reported growth and 6% organic growth year-over-year. We saw organic growth across all TE's businesses with the exception of SubCom.In Transportation, we grew 12% organically, well above our markets, with growth in each of our three businesses in the segment, as well as in all regions. In Industrial Solutions, we grew 5% organically with growth across all businesses and also in all regions and our Communications segment declined 6% organically as we expected. We did have 10% combined organic growth in data and devices and our appliances business, and this was more than offset by SubCom year-over-year declines.On the earnings side, from a margin perspective, in quarter three, we delivered 16.7% adjusted operating margins, with margin expansion in both the Transportation and Industrial segments. And one of the key highlights of the quarter was that our Industrial segment margins were up strong 150 basis points year-over-year.In the Communications segment, margins declined as we expected due to SubCom where we had a tough year-over-year comparison versus very strong revenue in the third quarter last year, along with a margin impact from the program delay that we highlighted back in our first quarter earnings call. The SubCom dynamics negatively impacted our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And when I look at our overall earnings, I'm very proud that we delivered 15% adjusted earnings per share growth, even with this headwind.",
                 'FTI': "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Matthew Seinsheimer. Please go ahead, Mr. Seinsheimer.Matthew Seinsheimer - TechnipFMC PlcGood afternoon, and welcome to TechnipFMC's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our news release and financial statements issued yesterday can be found on our website. I'd like to caution you with respect to any forward-looking statements made during this call. Although these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding future developments and business conditions, they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements.Known material factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are described in our most recent 10-K, most recent 10-Q and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the French AMF and the UK Financial Conduct Authority.We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speaks only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligations to publicly update or revise any of our forward-looking statements after the date they are made whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.I will now turn the call over to Doug Pferdehirt, TechnipFMC's Chief Executive Officer.Douglas J. Pferdehirt - TechnipFMC PlcThank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. Total company revenue in the quarter was $3.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $431 million benefited from further cost reduction, as well as another quarter of strong operational execution, a theme I will discuss in more detail on today's call.Looking at the business segments Subsea revenue and EBITDA demonstrated solid performance, as we continued to execute well on our backlog. Onshore/Offshore delivered exceptionally strong operating results, as evidenced by an improved EBITDA margin in the period. Revenue and margin for Surface Technologies were essentially flat when compared to the second quarter results despite softer market activity in North America, a risk we discussed on the second quarter earnings call. Total company inbound orders were $3.6 billion, with total company book-to-bill again above 1. Importantly, this has supported a return to year-over-year growth in total company backlog, up 9% when compared to the prior year quarter, with backlog growth occurring in all business segments.For Onshore/Offshore, we previously communicated an inbound target of $5 billion, with downstream opportunities including refining, fertilizer, and petrochemical project. We have made notable progress towards meeting this goal, including in the first quarter an award for the Bapco Sitra Refinery expansion in Bahrain, contracts for two fertilizer plants in India for the HURL joint venture in the second quarter and in this quarter, an award of Vietnam's largest olefins project for Long Son Chemicals (sic) [Long Son Petrochemicals] (00:03:47). This demonstrates our leadership in these important downstream markets, and we anticipate a further award in the near term.Turning to our operational performance, strong execution continues to be a reoccurring theme, across the project portfolio. In Onshore/Offshore, success is most evident in the performance of our largest individual project Yamal LNG. Despite the inherent complexity of the project size, scope, and location, execution has remained very strong.We successfully delivered LNG Train 1 in the fourth quarter of 2017. And during the third quarter of this year, we completed Train 2. We delivered the second train some six months ahead of the original schedule. This was in part a key driver of the quarterly performance improvement in Onshore/Offshore. Both trains have been operating within their nameplate design parameters; Train 2 reached this milestone in rapid fashion, just 17 days after first drop.And we approached the end of September, 68 cargos have been offloaded from the project, bringing cumulative LNG ship from Yamal to over 5 million metric tons. Our work on Yamal continues; construction and commissioning of Train 3 is progressing well and is on track for another early delivery.Our strong project execution extends beyond Onshore/Offshore. In Subsea, we have successfully delivered three integrated EPCI projects: Shell Kaikias of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which we discussed in detail last quarter and now two additional iEPCI projects in the third quarter, Visund Nord and Trestakk for our partner Equinor on the Norwegian continental shelf. In September, Equinor announced that Visund Nord had come on stream below budget and two months ahead of schedule. Project completion took just 21 months from concept selection to first production, a new fast-track record for Equinor. An important factor in the success of this project was the strong collaboration with our partner Equinor and the integrated capabilities of TechnipFMC.",
                 'TFX': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jake Elguicze, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jake Elguicze - Teleflex, Inc.Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Teleflex Incorporated third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The press release and slides to accompany this call are available on our website at www.teleflex.com. As a reminder, this call will be available on our website and a replay will be available by dialing 855-859-2056 or, for International calls, 404-537-3406; passcode 8158978.Participating on today's call are Liam Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Powell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Liam and Tom will provide prepared remarks and then we'll open up the call to Q&A.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the matters discussed in the conference call will contain forward-looking statements regarding future events as outlined in our slides. We wish to caution you that such statements are in fact forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially. The factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially include, but are not limited to, factors referenced in our press release today as well as our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K which can be accessed on our website.With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Liam.Liam J. Kelly - Teleflex, Inc.Thank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you again to discuss our third quarter financial results. Before we get into the details, I would like to say that we are very happy with our results this quarter and not simply because of the rebound in our organic constant currency revenue growth performance.In addition to good top line performance during the quarter: we also received 510(k) approval for Percuvance; we achieved positive results from our Phase 1 safety trial associated with RePlas; we acquired an innovative company in Essential Medical, which has their product focused on large bore closure that could be the first-to-market in the U.S.; and our two recently completed scale acquisitions NeoTract and Vascular Solutions continue to perform very well. The combination of each of these items give us further confidence in our ability to achieve our previously provided 2019 through 2021 financial targets that we outlined at our Analyst Day this past May.Turning now to our performance in the quarter, our third quarter results were a solid start to the second half of the year. During quarter three, revenue grew 14% on a reported basis and 15% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by a combination of continued excellent performance from our two recent scale acquisitions and a significant rebound in our organic constant currency revenue growth, which reached 5.6% for the quarter.Included in the 5.6% growth rate is approximately 1% from increased sales of Vascular Solutions products and a contribution of 4.6% from legacy Teleflex product line. I point this out to highlight that the core Teleflex product lines can deliver 4% revenue growth and can continue to perform at that level in the future.I am further encouraged by the step-up I saw in our North American tracings data, which is an excellent indicator of end-customer demand and, therefore, reaffirms our belief that the core business is performing well.During our second quarter conference call, we outlined a few events that we believed to be transient. And I'm pleased to say that, as we anticipated and expected, this proved to be the case. We also outlined the key drivers that we expected would accelerate our organic growth in the second half of the year. I am also very pleased to report that, thanks to strong execution across nearly all our strategic business units and the anticipated shift of distributor orders from quarter two to quarter three, we delivered upon our organic constant currency revenue growth expectations for the quarter.I also want to point out that we achieved this 5.6% organic constant currency revenue growth against our most difficult comparison of the year. Investors familiar with the Teleflex story will recall that, in the third quarter of last year, organic constant currency revenue growth was 5%. While we are obviously focused on continued execution in the fourth quarter, our year-to-date performance gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year organic constant currency revenue growth guidance of 5% to 5.5%, albeit we will most likely be at the low-end of that range.Turning to our recently completed scale acquisitions; UroLift continued its strong momentum, delivering $49 million in revenue, which is an increase of approximately 45% versus the prior-year period. Perhaps more impressive is that the Interventional Urology team delivered this growth by simultaneously overcoming a temporary supply issue that resulted from a proactive second quarter product recall that we noted on our last earnings call. I am pleased to report that, as of the end of quarter three, UroLift supply is now back to approximately 100%.I want to add my personal thanks to the entire Interventional Urology team who continue to execute at a very high level. In addition to delivering strong top line results and getting past the recall, UroLift was also the subject of five real-world studies at an international urology conference during the quarter and the team continued to expand its leadership position as the BPH therapy with the largest body of clinical evidence supporting safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.Turning to Vascular Solutions, third quarter revenues reached $53.2 million globally, which represented growth of over 21% compared to the prior-year period. Vascular Solutions world-wide revenue growth was robust in both North America and EMEA, which continues to benefit from distributor conversions we initiated in the second half of 2017. We remain confident in the continued performance of VSI in the fourth quarter and we anticipate strong year-over-year revenue growth.Turning to some other key metrics; during the quarter, our adjusted gross and operating margins reached 57% and 26%, respectively. And our various restructuring initiatives remain on track to achieve the synergy level we previously expected. Our performance this quarter translated into adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, which is an increase of 18.9% over third quarter 2017. And despite foreign currency exchange rate being less favorable as compared to when we last provided guidance, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from a range of between $9.70 and $9.90 per share to a range of between $9.80 and $9.95 per share.",
                 'TXN': 'David PahlGood afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.I’ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago; however, demand for our products slowed across most markets during thequarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago.Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with communications equipment as the exception. In communications equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps, while Embedded products declined from a year ago, as we expected. Without the decline in communications equipment, Embedded would have grown.With that backdrop, I’ll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to berepresentative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that’s long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output.We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion, taken together these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners.I’ll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue decreased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontrollers was about even. In our Other segment, revenue declined 6% primarily due to custom products, as we expected.Now, I’ll provide some insight into this quarter’s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper-single digit growth with most sectors growing year-on-year.Automotive grew double-digits from a year ago, but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines at others. Communications equipment increased low-single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. And these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?Rafael LizardiThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected.On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.',
                 'TXT': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go ahead.Eric SalanderThanks, Brad, and good morning everyone.Before we begin, I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various Risk Factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down $284 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we recorded an after-tax gain of $410 million related to the sale of the tools and test product line for $1.65 per share. Excluding this item, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share, down $0.04 from last year's third quarter.Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $259 million compared to $281 million in last year's third quarter.With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.Scott DonnellyThanks, Eric, and good morning everybody.Revenue was down in the quarter primarily driven by the tools and test acquisition with an industrial and lower TAPV volumes with systems as that program continues to runoff. Segment profit was down in the quarter largely due to lower profit in Industrial which more than offset higher profit at Bell and Aviation.At Industrial, segment profit was breakeven primarily due to unfavorable operating performance in specialized vehicles. Specialized vehicles has undergone significant change over the past two years, as we have expanded the product portfolio. While we've seen increasing revenue in the segment, we haven't seen the planned level of growth or do the operating levers necessary to support the expected returns.We've made progress on new product introductions and continue to be encouraged by the favorable trends in the power sports market but we need to work on our go-to-market strategy and focus on cost performance. We are focused on driving improvements in this business and believe that we have valuable power of our portfolio moving forward.Moving to Bell, profits were up in the quarter, and operating margin expanded on slightly lower revenues. On the commercial side, we delivered 43 helicopters up from 39 in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, we further expanded the global operating footprint of 505 Jet Ranger X with a delivery into Kenya marking the first 505 in Africa.Also in the quarter, the 525 program completed half weather and high altitude testing in Yuma, Arizona, as the aircraft continues to meet or exceed all design specifications as it progresses towards its planned certification in 2019.On the military side, Bell is awarded a $510 million contract for 29 AH-1 helicopters in support of the Marine Corps H-1 upgrade program. We also feature the UH1 at NATO days in Ostrava and Czech Air Force Base. Bell is the largest security show in Europe as we continue to market this multi little aircraft to our international military customers.Moving into military products the V-280 recently exceeded 215 ops as the team continues to successfully expand the aircraft's flight envelope and validate key performance parameters.Also during the quarter, Bell unveiled a full scale markup of the V-247 unmanned aerosystem at Fort Myers in Arlington, Virginia for a review by DoD leadership as well as representatives from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Army, to give them a better understanding of the proposed capabilities of this Group by UAS.At Systems, revenues were down on lower TAPV deliveries of Textron Marine and Land systems as we near the end of that program. At Marine and Land Systems we were awarded a $100 million contract for procurement of long lead material to support the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector program.Marine and Land Systems also completed pre-delivery inspection and trials of its common unmanned surface vehicle and is now in the development testing phase.Earlier this week, we also announced our intent to form a joint venture between Textron and Flight Safety International to serve our Textron Aviation customers. This combination of capabilities will enable us to provide best-in-class pilot and maintenance training programs to our customers around the world through a more extensive network of training centers.Moving to Textron Aviation, I would like to address the change in leadership that I announced last Friday, with the deployment of Ron Draper as CEO of the Aviation segment succeeding Scott Ernest who has moved to Textron's Specialized Vehicles as their new CEO. This move is consistent with our strategy of developing leaders within our businesses. Ron was Textron Aviation's Senior Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain and as such led all aspects of manufacturing operations of Textron Aviation since 2012. Ron has a great depth of knowledge about the Aviation business and has led several Textron Aviation's most impactful strategic initiatives to-date including the successful integration of our Cessna Beechcraft operations, expansion of our quality management systems, and global sourcing strategies. I'm confident in his abilities to lead Textron Aviation through its next phases of product development and growth.",
                 'TMO': "I would now like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.Kenneth J.

Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q3 call and, Ken, happy birthday.I'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong growth momentum and delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. Our team executed very well in a strong market environment and continued to capture opportunities to drive growth. Our outstanding performance underscores the impact of our proven growth strategy. We're clearly delivering a differentiated experience for our customers, and that's driving meaningful share gains across our businesses. We have a lot of highlights to cover this quarter and I'll start with an overview of our financial results.As you saw in our press release this morning, our adjusted EPS grew 13% to $2.62 per share in Q3. Our revenue in the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to $5.92 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.31 billion and our adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 22.1%. The combination of great execution by our team and strong market conditions led to outstanding results again this quarter. Our performance puts us in great position to deliver a fantastic 2018.Now, let me give you a little color on our performance by end market. All of our end markets were strong in Q3. We took advantage of the favorable conditions and effectively leveraged our customer value proposition to drive growth. In pharma and biotech, we delivered high-teens growth in the quarter and continued to see strength in all of our businesses serving this end market. As you know, we're uniquely positioned to enable success for our pharma and biotech customers and that results in significant share gain for Thermo Fisher.Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter and saw strong growth – strong demand in this end market. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits. It was great to see a continuation of the positive funding dynamics in the U.S. during the quarter. And finally, in industrial and applied, we delivered high-single digit growth in Q3 led by strong performance across our Analytical Instruments businesses.A quick comment on our overall performance from a geographic lens: we continued to see good conditions in our end markets globally and this was highlighted by another very strong quarter in China where we delivered more than 20% growth. So, it was another great quarter. We executed very well to capitalize on the strong market conditions across the board.As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, our results point to our proven growth strategy and our ability to execute consistently over a long period of time. We've been building on our leadership position by making significant investments in R&D, leveraging our scale in high-growth regions, and providing increasing value for our customers.",
                 'TIF': 'At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.Mark AaronThank you everyone for joining us on today’s call. I hope you have all had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. Alessandro and Mark have some brief comments to share with you, and then we will be pleased to take your questions.Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially as well as the required reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures referenced in this presentation to their comparable GAAP measures is set forth in Tiffany’s Form 10-Q filed earlier today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. Those filings can be found on Tiffany’s investor website, www.investor.tiffany.com, by selecting Financial Information in the left-hand column.I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Alessandro.Alessandro BoglioloThanks Mark, and hello everyone. The details of our financial results are contained in today’s news release and 10-Q filing, so we decided to abrogate our formal comments in order to have more time to answer your questions. But before taking any questions, I want to spend a few minutes commenting on some highlights of those results and the relevance to our long-term strategy. Mark Erceg will then address the financial results and the outlook.I joined Tiffany a little more than one year ago and I cannot be more pleased with and appreciative of what our team has accomplished in a short time. Worldwide net sales have increased 10% in the year to date with balanced performance throughout the business. We have modernized our marketing communications and accelerated new product innovations, and enhanced our store base. I previously said that we are on a long and exciting journey, and I’m pleased to report that we had a good start.Earlier this year, we laid out our six key strategic priorities and also said that we would be increasing investment spending in several areas in order to support sustainable sales growth. Despite some external factors that have mitigated a portion of our recent sales growth and the related near-term uncertainties, I am encouraged and as confident as ever about the long term path that we are on.Communicating brand relevance and desirability begins at home to local customers in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe. In this objective, we are making good progress. We have increased the sales attributed to local customers in each of the first three quarters of the year and in all regions. Such gains were partly offset in the third quarter in some markets by lower sales attributed to foreign tourists, particularly to Chinese. Of course, jewelry sales for Tiffany and the overall industry can be volatile due to currency shifts, regulations, travel patterns and other factors.In the third quarter, sales attributed to Chinese tourists were lower in the Americas and in Hong Kong, as well as wholesale sales to Korean duty-free operators related to Chinese jewelry purchases, which had been very strong for several quarters. But on the contrary, we have achieved healthy double-digit sales growth in mainland China throughout the year with even stronger momentum in local currency in the third quarter. We can speculate on the reasons for the tourist spending slowdown outside of China, but the reality is that the Tiffany brand is appealing to Chinese customers, as evidenced by the continued strong sales growth in mainland China in the quarter.Another objective is to achieve increased jewelry unit volume, and I’m pleased that overall jewelry unit volume has increased in all three quarters of the year. Consistent with this, product innovation that is more frequent and distinctive is one of our priorities, and we have been exciting customers this year with the launches of the Paper Flowers and Tiffany True collections, as well as making additions to existing jewelry collections such as Tiffany T, Tiffany Keys, HardWear, and Return to Tiffany. In fact, in September we celebrated the launch of Paper Flowers in Shanghai with a major event attended by hundreds of customers, celebrities, and influencers. The resonance across digital and traditional media all over China has been spectacular.',
                 'TWTR': "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.Great, thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter published on our Investor Relations website a little while ago.This morning we'll begin with just a few brief remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2018 and our operational plans and strategies.Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.Good morning, everyone. We're going to try something a little bit different instead of reading prepared remarks, I'm just going to spend a few minutes talking about some of the highlights we've had over the quarter.I wanted to start with our purpose. Our purpose is to serve the public conversation. And we have a singular objective within that purpose, which is around increasing health of the public conversation.As a reminder, health is a framework for us that allows us to think cohesively around abuse, misinformation, echo chambers and manipulation. And the first thing I wanted to highlight is, we continue to make really steady progress against some of the health initiatives that we're seeing, most notably this quarter around suspicious sign-ups. So we saw a 20% decrease since introducing some new techniques. We see a lot more spammy sign-ups prevalent on the web. And as we detailed in our Shareholder Letter, we've seen a decrease in web daily usage and the double-digit growth on mobile daily usage.We tend to see a lot more of the, sort of, scripted automation coming through the web versus the API. So this is pretty meaningful in terms of our objective around increasing health.And as another reminder, we do see health as a growth vector over the long-term. This is an extremely important initiative to us not only for the experience of Twitter, but we believe the long-term growth of a platform and we're really proud of our progress so far. We've seen continued usage increase and growth of daily usage has been really strong 9% year-over-year. We attribute a lot of this to our focus on conversations. One of our initiatives is to make sure that we are focusing on making Twitter a lot more conversational. We believe that conversations is Twitter's superpower and we have made it a lot easier to find the conversations around events that you care about.So a lot of you have probably noticed, if you're following a particular sports team or a local news event or a global conversation around a particular event, you should see the live event right at the timeline, right at the top of your timeline as its happening. If you tap into that, you see the entire event. If we have a live video stream associated with it you see that. If we have any recap video streams associated with it, you see that. But also you see the conversation. And we've organized the conversation in three ways. One in a recap, so you can quickly catch up to everything that matters in terms of what happened within that event; all the top commentary around the event and these are authoritative voices, folks of credibility around a particular domain area. So for any particular sporting team that might be the beat reporter or the team or someone within the league and their tweets and their conversation.",
                 'TJX': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.Ernie HerrmanThanks, Elan. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.Debra McConnellThank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company’s results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company’s plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company’s SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed April 4, 2018.Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies, Inc.

Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.We have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today’s press release and the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investors section.Thank you and now I will turn it back over to Ernie.Ernie HerrmanGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. I want to start today by saying that our hearts go out to everyone affected by the wildfires in California, the recent hurricanes Florence and Michael, and here in Massachusetts, the natural gas fires in Essex County. At TJX, we take our commitment to helping those in need seriously and one way we support our communities is through disaster relief efforts.As part of this long-standing commitment, and in addition to our annual contribution to the American Red Cross for disaster relief, we are making incremental donations from our charitable foundation to the Red Cross. We are also donating to Habitat for Humanity and other local charitable organizations to support the respective relief and long-term recovery efforts in the impacted areas.Moving to the third quarter, I’m very pleased with our excellent results. Consolidated comp store sales growth of 7% and earnings per share of $0.61 both exceeded our expectations. Our teams across the company drove excellent execution of our off-price fundamentals and each of our four major divisions delivered strong comp sales and customer traffic increases. This marked the 17th consecutive quarter that customer traffic was up at TJX and Marmaxx. Further, we saw continued momentum in our apparel businesses across the company.We believe our strong third quarter results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our off-price treasure hunt. Staying focused on offering consumers great merchandise and great values continues to be our winning formula. We are convinced that we are continuing to gain market share in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia, which is great for our future.With our very strong third quarter results, we are raising our full-year comp and adjusted EPS outlook, which Scott will detail in a moment. Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is off to a solid start and we have many initiatives planned to keep driving traffic and sales this holiday season and beyond.We enter the fourth quarter well-positioned to take advantage of the plentiful buying opportunities we see in the marketplace and we will be flowing fresh merchandise selections throughout the holiday season. Longer term, we remain confident that we will continue our successful growth in the U.S. and around the world.Before I continue, I will turn the call over to Scott to recap our third quarter numbers. Scott.Scott GoldenbergThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, all earnings per share items and share figures reflect the November 6th two-for-one stock split.As Ernie mentioned, consolidated comparable store sales increased 7% and were significantly above our expectations. Once again, customer traffic was up overall and was the primary driver of our comp sales increases at all divisions, as we believe we are capturing market share. As a reminder, our comp increase excludes the growth from our e-commerce businesses.Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.61, which includes a pension settlement charge of $0.02 that was not contemplated in our guidance. Excluding this charge and a $0.09 benefit from the 2017 Tax Act, adjusted earnings per share were $0.54, an 8% increase over last year’s $0.50 and well above the high end of our plan.',
                 'TMK': "Good day, and welcome to the Torchmark Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded.For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, VP, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.Michael MajorsSome of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2017 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.Gary ColemanThank you, Mike, and good morning everyone.In the third quarter, net income was $179 million or $1.55 per share compared to $153 million or $1.29 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $183 million or $1.59 per share, a per share increase of 29% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, we estimate that the growth would have been approximately 10%.On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of September 30, was 4.4%, and book value per share was $48.35. Excluding unrealized gains and losses of fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.7%, and book value per share grew 26% to $43.10.In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $606 million and life underwriting margin was $169 million up 10% from a year ago. The growth in the underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at American Income and Direct Response. For the year we expect life underwriting income to grow around 7%.On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $255 million and health underwriting margin was up 8% to $60 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins at Family Heritage and American Income. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow at around 8%.Administrative expenses were $56 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in-line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.4% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to be up around 5% and around 6.5% of premium compared to 6.4% in 2017.I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations.Larry HutchisonThank you, Gary.At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $273 million and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $93 million. Net life sales were $55 million, down 5%. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7,105 down 1% from a year ago but up 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,066.While we're still optimistic about American income's growth potential, we do have some great challenges. First we have opened 10 new offices this year. Well, this is great news because it supports sustainable long-term growth. It doesn't have production in the near-term as top middle managers leave existing offices to become agency owners in new offices.In addition, our economic conditions have historically, have a little impact on agent growth at American income unemployment is currently at a 50 year low. This is resulted in an uptick in new agent termination of rates due to the abundance of other career opportunities.There is one issue however that we do not consider to be a challenge. There have been reports and discussion recently regarding the potential impact of the Supreme Court ruling that prohibits public unions on assessing collective bargaining fees to non-union members. As we said on the last call, we do not believe this will have a significant impact at American income. We expect to see a reduction of only about 2% in American incomes overall lead production as a result of the ruling.In addition we do not expect an impact to the persistency of our in force business. These policies were individual policies, not tied to union membership. The premium to collect it directly from the individual policyholders.As we have discussed previously, the great majority of our new business leads are non-union leads. Furthermore, our union leads are more weighted towards private unions. Our American income is a Labor Advisory Board has significant representation from public unions, our penetration into public union membership has historically been low.There is no correlation between the makeup of our advisory board and our mix of business or leads. Actually, we believe the court's ruling creates an opportunity to accrue relationships with public unions as they make ways to incorporate programs that add value the union membership.At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $70 million while life underwriting margin was down 11% to $17 million. Net life sales increased 1% to $12 million and net health sales were $5 million, up 4% from the year ago quarter. The average producing agent account for the third quarter was 2,180, up 2% from a year ago and approximately the same as the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,021.",
                 'TSS': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Shawn RobertsThank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. We'll begin this evening's call with opening comments by TSYS' Chairman, President and CEO, Troy Woods; followed by TSYS' CFO, Paul Todd, reviewing the third quarter highlights and consolidated financials. Troy and Paul will both be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investors.tsys.com. After the prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions].I'd now like to call your attention to the fact that we will be making forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC, including its 2017 annual report on Form 10-K. I will also discuss items that do not conform to GAAP. We reconcile those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules to the press release.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Troy Woods.Troy WoodsThank you, Shawn. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Our global TSYS team has delivered another quarter of solid results as we continue to execute on our strategic goals and fulfill our vision of being a leading global payment solutions provider. Some of the highlights for the quarter that I would like to call out are: net revenue increased by 13.1%; net income was up 26.7%; adjusted EBITDA increased 12.6%; and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.16.During the quarter, we reduced our debt another $175 million, bringing our year-to-date reduction to $355 million. With this reduction, we have achieved our deleveraging commitment after our acquisition of Cayan one quarter earlier than anticipated.The ability to accelerate our deleveraging commitment will allow us to use our strong free cash flow to resume our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter. These strong results, coupled with a very healthy economy and consumer confidence levels at an all-time high, enables us to again increase our guidance for the third time this year and fuel our momentum as we go into the final quarter of 2018. Paul will go into more details on our guidance increase in his comments.In recognition of our performance, during the quarter, we received several important honors. In July, Forbes ranked TSYS #116 on its Global 2000 Growth Champions List, which recognizes the top 250 performers based on compounded annual growth rates from 2014 to 2017.In September, TSYS was ranked number eight on International Data Corporation's Financial Insights' 2018 FinTech Top 100 based on financial services revenue totals. Finally, I am pleased to announce that our own CIO, Patty Watson, was named one of the 20 Women Who Mean Business by the Atlanta Business Chronicle in September. We are very proud of these recognitions and honors and thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication.Now I would like to address a few key items across our enterprise then ask Paul to provide additional financial highlights.It was another very strong quarter for Issuer Solutions. Some highlights include total traditional accounts on file ended at $594.4 million, up 5.8%. Total transactions were up 12%, and net revenue was $434.3 million, an increase of 8.3% on a reported basis and 8.8% on a constant currency basis. All of these were new records for our Issuer Solutions segment.On the business development front, we signed extensions with Navy Federal Credit Union, Barclays, MB Financial and Regions Bank. As part of the Regions agreement, TSYS will also begin processing Regions commercial credit card portfolio and will support the bank's commercial ePayables offering through our Virtual Payment Precept platform.In other new business during the quarter, we successfully converted approximately 4.5 million combined Bass Pro and Cabela's accounts for Capital One. We also have the commitment from Capital One to convert two additional retail and co-brand portfolios to TSYS in 2019. In addition to the new Regions commercial card business and Capital One's new commitment, we have a very solid new business pipeline, which will add new business over the next 24 months.On the product development front, as we reported the last few quarters, we have a large pipeline of new products in fraud, data and analytics, digital engagement, customer service, authentication and our communications platform. All in all, we are very pleased with our third quarter results for Issuer Solutions and excited about our momentum moving into the holiday period.",

We will be available for the call for follow-up.Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg.Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. To begin this morning, I want to thank all of the Tractor Supply and Petsense team members for their tremendous efforts during the recent hurricane season as they went the country mile for many of our customers. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all of our team members and the communities who have been directly impacted by the recent hurricanes.Now, to the business results, we are delighted with our strong third quarter performance, driven by overall robust sales growth. Once again, our results were driven by broad-based strength across all geographic regions as well as increases in both comparable average ticket and traffic, and all merchandising divisions achieved positive comp sales in the quarter. Our third quarter results represent the fifth consecutive quarter of comp store sales above 3% as we cycled our most difficult quarterly comparison of a year ago.During the quarter the Tractor Supply team executed well across many of our areas; store operations, merchandising, supply chain and planning and placement. While the overall retail economy is doing well, our teams did a great job of developing plans that resonated with our customers that were seasonally relevant and continue to drive transactions and our average ticket. We continue to be in stock for our customers with our everyday basic assortments that we know our customers depend on from Tractor Supply, that help them live their Out Here lifestyle.As I shared with you last quarter, I believe the macro backdrop for our consumers is relatively healthy given the recent trends in unemployment and consumer confidence. For Tractor Supply, the macro headwinds we've experienced over the last several years have abated and the team is now in a position to capitalize on the current consumer trends. We continue to see some benefit from energy-related markets, along with inflationary trends, both of which are positively contributing to our top-line performance.Given our performance to the third quarter, we are raising our full year outlook given the ongoing strength in our business. We believe our merchandising, marketing efforts along with our ONETractor strategy initiatives have well positioned us for years to come.Let us touch on a few highlights for the third quarter as compared to third quarter last year. Net sales increased 9.3% to $1.8 billion for the quarter as we stayed the course on our strategy to open new stores at both Tractor Supply and Petsense. Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the third quarter with comp average ticket increasing 3.6% and transactions growing at plus 1.4% in the quarter. This quarter marks 41 out of 42 quarters that our customer traffic count has been positive. Consistent with the second quarter of this year, the average ticket increase continued to be among the best we have had in the last six years.",
                 'TDG': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Liza Sabol, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.Liza Sabol - TransDigm Group, Inc.Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; and Senior Vice President of Finance, Jim Skulina.A replay of today's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks and replay information is contained in this morning's press release and on our website at transdigm.com. It should also be noted that our Form 10-Q will be filed tomorrow and will also be found on our website.Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that the statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC found through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to those measures.I will now turn the call over to Nick.W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in today. Today I'll start off with a brief overview of our recent organization announcements, some summary and comments on our consistent strategy, a quick overview summary of the third quarter and fiscal year 2018. Kevin will review the business performance for the quarter and the year; and Jim will then run through the financials.As you may have seen, we recently announced three significant organization changes. Mike Lisman has been elected by the board to be our new Chief Financial Officer. Mike brings a very attractive set of skills and experience to the new job. His experience in private equity and investment banking provides a key element to our new management team.Mike has worked with us for about three years in both operations and M&A roles. He knows the company and culture well. Interestingly, Mike has a degree in aerospace engineering. So like Kevin, Bernie, Jorge, and I can help with engineering work in a pinch. That's a joke by the way.Unverified ParticipantYeah. I hope so.W. Nicholas Howley - TransDigm Group, Inc.Not that he has a degree, but he can help. Mike is a good cultural fit and a great candidate. Kevin and I both believe he's going to do a fine job. Bernie Iversen will continue to report to me and remains Executive Vice President of Merger & Acquisition. Jim Skulina has agreed to continue as Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer for a six to 12-month period to assist Mike in the transition.Jorge Valladares has been elected by the Board of Directors as the Chief Operating Officer of our Power Systems segment. Jorge came to TransDigm almost right out of college and has been with the company in a broad range of operating positions for about 20 years. Jorge is a proven executive and an outstanding cultural fit. Kevin will expand on this a little.Now to reiterate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize why we believe that, about 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. Over three-quarters of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability in the downturns. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.To do that, we follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple well-proven value-based operating methodology. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that very closely aligns our management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit our strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and allocation as a key part of our value creation methodology.",
                 'TRV': "At this time, I would like to turn your conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.Abbe GoldsteinThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com, under the Investors section.Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our website.And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.Alan SchnitzerThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you've seen our numbers and we're pleased with the results. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $709 million or $2.62 per diluted share, generating return on equity of 12.6%. Core income was $687 million or $2.54 per diluted share.Our core return on equity of 12% was strong, particularly considering that while catastrophe and non-cat weather losses were significantly lower than last year's quarter. In the aggregate, they were nonetheless elevated relative to our expectation.Our performance this quarter is the result of excellent underwriting execution across a diverse portfolio of businesses, a successful and consistent investment strategy, and the continuation of our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Notably, our results this quarter benefited from record high net earned premium and the sub-30% consolidated expense ratio, reflecting progress that we're making on our strategic agenda.About a year ago, we explained that our strategic plans were largely geared toward creating top-line opportunities and that improving productivity and efficiency was an important component of our strategy. Each of our business segments has contributed on both counts. They've done so by successfully implementing technology workflow and product enhancements, and by making sure that we're delivering compelling value to our customers and distribution partners.Before I get further into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by hurricanes Florence and Michael. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted. Following events like these, our claim organization works hard to make sure that our customers see the value of the promise they bought from us, and our agent and brokers see the value of the Travelers' promise they sold.Case in point, as of today, we've closed more than 90% of our homeowners' claims arising out of Hurricane Florence. And we're bringing the same level of urgency for our customers impacted by Hurricane Michael. We're thankful for the extraordinary effort by our claim professionals.Turning to production, we were pleased with the success of our marketplace execution. Growth in each segment contributed to consolidated net written premium growth of 6%.In domestic business insurance, retentions remain historical highs, which is a reflection of the fact we have a high quality book of business and the significant percentage of it is meeting our return expectations.Renewal premium change, including pure rate and exposure, is strong at around 5%, which is about 2 points higher than in the prior year quarter and stable sequentially. Inside that, pure rate is up about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and down a little sequentially. And economic activity is contributing to a healthy level of exposure growth.",

Please go ahead.Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.In the release you'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. You'll also find supplemental financial information which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today November 8, 2018. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Now, here's Steve who will share a few thoughts before we open the call up to questions.Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. To summarize our prepared remarks from last night, we posted a strong quarter. We're hitting our key 2018 objectives. We expect healthy EBITDA growth next year and we're investing in a number of attractive growth opportunities. We've put the business on a great path and we're excited about what's ahead. Let's now open up the call for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Your first question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is open.Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, on Non-Hotel, when should we expect the impacts of rentals to kind of moderate from a timing standpoint? You're calling for acceleration in 4Q Non-Hotel revenues. Should we assume that the impact from rentals is starting to moderate starting 4Q?And then second, on hotel shoppers, you noted that the referrals to partner sites grew in the letter. That's impressive considering the marketing reductions. How would you rank order your marketing efforts versus product initiatives, that's sort of delivering this? And then are you also seeing cost per referrals increase at this time? Thank you.Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.Deepak, good morning. This is Ernst. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Steve to take the second one. What we called out in our prepared remarks is that there is some seasonality to the relative influence of rentals. Q3 is a quarter in which rentals is relatively larger in the portfolio compared to other quarters and so it had an outsized impact for that reason in the overall rate for Non-Hotel. That is less so in Q4.And over time, of course, with our restaurant business and our experience business growing quite fast and rentals actually at the moment declining single digit, the mix shift will result into rentals having a smaller and smaller impact.Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.And this is Steve talking about the referrals that we sent downstream to our partners on lower hotel shopper number. I mean, it's certainly a truism that all shoppers are not created equal and so this is a two-part answer. The first is I think we found better ways to find the type of hotel shoppers that are naturally more interested in booking something right now. So, we're better able to buy, we'll call them, lower funnel shoppers. So the overall number may be lower, but the quality of them coming into the store, to our store, is higher.And then second, once they're coming in, yes, we continue to make meaningful gains in on-site conversion, especially on the phone, which is driving more downstream referrals. So we don't look specifically at how much we spend per referral, we always look at it as how much profit can we make for every referral that we buy.Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ernst.Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.Thank you.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the new TripAdvisor Experience. Is there any color you guys can give us on the test markets around engagement and the impact on monetization that gives you the confidence to roll that out to, I think, most of the globe in the next few weeks?",
                 'FOXA': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.Reed NolteThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we’ll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then we’ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox’s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company’s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.Please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.And with that, I’m pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.Lachlan MurdochThanks, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before giving comments on the quarter’s results, I’ll take just a minute to provide an update on the two transactions we announced at the end of 2017. But first, we want to note recent press reports about the potential of a further offer for our businesses. Consistent with past practice, we are not going to comment on market speculation.And regarding our agreement with Disney, we jointly filed a preliminary proxy three weeks ago. It is a detailed filing that should answer any questions people have about this transaction. Once finalized and cleared by the SEC, we anticipate being in a position this summer to request shareholder approval for both the merger with Disney and the creation of New Fox.Planning for New Fox is well underway and we’ll keep you posted on our progress, including announcements on the new company’s leadership team and organizational structure. In the meantime, we are making strategic investments such as the addition of key sports markets through our acquisition of 7 Sinclair stations announced this morning and our deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football that will deliver New Fox the very best content available.Now let me provide some highlights on the company’s performance this past quarter. A couple of things really stand out. First and foremost, the earnings power of our Cable Networks. This segment delivered 16% growth and its highest EBITDA quarter ever. While John will provide more detail from the financials, much of this strength was driven by continued double-digit affiliate revenue growth at both our domestic and international channels businesses. This growth reflects the strength of our video brands to distributors and audiences. Cumulative domestic subscribers grew year-over-year, driven by subscriber gains at our younger channels as well as the continued ramp in new virtual MVPD subscriptions.We saw continued strength in sports and news, demonstrating the competitive advantage of our outstanding brands and content that are primarily viewed live. The Fox News Channel achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA in its history. Its younger sibling, Fox Business Network, beat its competition in viewership for the sixth consecutive quarter.Our domestic cable sports networks were also major drivers of profitability with our local RSN and national sports networks, FOX Sports 1 and FOX Sports 2, generating double-digit earnings growth. The RSN saw higher viewership this past NBA season and ratings for the new Major League Baseball season are up as well.We also delivered creatively, generating long-term value to the standout entertainment content we produce and monetize. At our Broadcast Network, new hits, 911 and The Resident; and strong returning shows, Empire and STAR, drove growth in season-to-date total audience over a year ago. This coming Monday, we will announce next season’s schedule at our upfront presentation and we could be not more excited by the lineup.At FX, we had a successful run with the second installment of the American Crime Story saga, The Assassination Of Gianni Versace, and the current seasons of Atlanta and the final installment of The Americans are each performing well.Our film studio had a great setup for the quarter with holiday releases that continued to deliver at the box office supported by industry-leading awards recognition. These include The Greatest Showman; Three Billboards; and the Oscar Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. The home entertainment release of these films, along with the theatrical release of Deadpool 2 next week, should propel a strong film fourth fiscal quarter.',

Thanks for joining us today. While our business continued to grow in the third quarter, we are clearly not satisfied with our results, particularly in our Chicken segment. Intertwined with uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs are increasing supplies of relatively low-priced beef and pork that are competing with chicken.Typically, in Q3 and Q4, we expect strong chicken demand, driven by the growing season and normal summer future activity. Instead, cool Memorial Day weekend weather curved demand, while competing proteins displaced chicken in retail and foodservice promotions. To recover, we are aggressively addressing costs and capturing new future activity. And by keeping our inventories low, we can quickly react to market changes.Rising freight costs have been a challenge for all of our businesses. We now expect freight to be about $270 million more this year compared to last year, with a net effect for FY 2018 estimated to be around $0.33 per share. On a run rate basis, we recovered about 85%, and we plan to reach 100% once our longer-term contracts expire and new pricing terms take effect.Our efforts to recover price are likely curving short-term growth. We are growing, but not as fast as we could be and not as fast as we want to be. Despite the current trade issues, global protein demand continues to grow. Our products are moving in the export markets albeit at lower values. We are working to strengthen our existing relationships, certain markets and build inroads into new markets.In Q3, we demonstrated the value of playing across all proteins. We delivered strong results in our Beef and Prepared Foods segments, offsetting lower margins in chicken and pork. Sales volume of value-added products was up 2.6% compared to the third quarter last year.We are managing costs tightly across the company. Ongoing Financial Fitness savings were $66 million in the quarter and $168 million year-to-date. We are on track to exceed our $200 million target this year and an incremental $400 million over the next two years. Having this cost program and the continuous improvement mindset already established is proving to be beneficial when facing the current challenges in the market.While we are focused on costs, we are also making strategic investments in our people and our business. Our efforts to improve employee satisfaction are already proving results with improved safety and retention in tight labor markets. Our CapEx investments are yielding real P&L benefits by driving innovation and improving supply chain capabilities and production flexibility.Now I’m going to ask that Stewart takes us through the financials as well as our segment results in Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods. Stewart?Stewart GlendinningThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter EPS of $1.50 is up 2% compared to Q3 last year, excluding the $0.20 tax benefit. As we announced last week, we revised our annual EPS guidance down to $5.70 to $6 per share.",
                 'UDR': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President, Chris Van Ens. Thank you, Mr. Van Ens. You may begin.Chris Van EnsWelcome to UDR's quarterly financial results conference call. Our quarterly press release and supplemental disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we've reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit your questions and follow-ups. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman, CEO, and President, Tom Toomey.Thomas ToomeyThank you, Chris, and welcome to UDR's third quarter 2018 conference call. On the call with me today are Jerry Davis, Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results; as well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.There are three key points I'd like to make about our business and the macroeconomic environment. First, we again produced very good results across all aspects of our business during the quarter. These results and the positive outlook drove our second guidance increase this year, in earnings per share and same-store growth ranges. Jerry and Joe will discuss these in detail in their prepared remarks.Second, the underlying macroeconomic backdrop for the apartment industry remains positive. This when combined with solid fundamentals will continue to support future growth. As such, we expect the apartments will remain a consistent short-term and long-term performer in a very volatile global economic landscape.Third, and turning to 2019, we are optimistic about our prospects. We remain confident in our innovative platform and the expected earnings from it, as well as the improved bottom line contribution from our lease-up communities first [ph] 2018. From a capital allocation standpoint, we remain flexible, and we'll continue to invest in uses that provide the best risk adjusted return. We'll provide details at 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.Last, to all my fellow associates in the field and corporate offices, we thank you for producing another quarter strong results.With that I will turn it over to Jerry.Jerry DavisThanks, Tom, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter's strong operator results. Third quarter year-over-year revenue and NOI growth for our same-store pool, which represents approximately 83% of total NOI were 3.8% and 3.9% respectively. Please note that excluding the impending sale of our Circle Towers community located in the Washington D.C. market and this commensurate move to held for sale, quarterly same-store revenue growth would have been 3.7% in the quarter, we're the top-end of the range we've provided in early September.Maybe none, as Tom indicated, business is strong, seven points I would like to highlight from the quarter are as follows: first, every year same-store revenue growth of 3.8% exhibited continued acceleration versus the 3% and 3.4% growth rates we produced in the first and second quarters.Secondly, market rents accelerated through the end of August before retreating slightly in September. As such, 2018 has exhibited more typical seasonality than any of the prior three years. Well, we had anticipated this coming into 2018, the durability of the market rent growth throughout the prime leasing season was welcomed. We are definitely benefiting from stronger job growth in our markets thus far in 2018, which has been 40 basis points better than an initial estimates and solid last 12 month wage growth that is average 3.2%. Combined, our markets have outpaced national total income growth by 90 basis points over the trailing 12 months.Third, every year blended lease rate growth for the quarter was 60 basis points higher than during the same period last year. This is 40 basis points wider and what was realized during the first half of 2018. We expect this gap to continue to widen in the fourth quarter.Fourth, other income grew by nearly 14 % in the quarter, well above our expectations. Our operating initiatives continue to grow at rates many multiples of rent growth and remain a primary contributor to our sector leading 2018 same-store revenue guidance.",

We delivered 7.8% comp sales growth on top of 10.3% comps in the third quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share of $2.18 grew 28%. We just shared a lot of news at our Analyst Day last month, and today, I’ll reiterate some of the information we discussed about each of our strategic imperatives, which position us to deliver industry-leading financial results.I’ll begin with our efforts to drive loyalty and to take our brands to the next level. We grow our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program to $30.6 million active members at the end of the third quarter, a 15.3% year-over-year increase. Loyalty member sales now represent more than 95% of our total revenues.We continue to benefit from the high engagement of our Platinum and Diamond level guests, garnering more than 40% share of wallet from these two tiers combined. These guests are over three times more likely than our average guests to be omni-channel shoppers and take advantage of our services offering. They also have extremely high retention levels at more than 96%.Going forward, we expect to increase our focus on driving higher sales per member and personalization is the next major tool for growing share of wallet. Our vision is to make every guest touchpoint personalized and relevant, building tools and capabilities to develop a closer connection to our guests, so they feel even deeper loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand.We’re just in the early innings of personalization, and we’re building expertise, both internally and through acquisitions to bolster our capabilities in this area. More on this topic in a bit. We also continue to grow our credit card portfolio and see a sustained business sales for our guests, who hold the Ulta Beauty credit card. Sales of gift cards grew 35% in the quarter, driven by expanding distribution and other retailers this year, as well as strong growth in our own stores.We continue to grow awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, now reaching all-time highs at 55% for unaided and 92% for aided awareness for the quarter. These milestones are supported by significant improvements on important brand attributes such as being considered exciting, fun, inspiring, experts in beauty and on trend.Last quarter, we discussed the launch of our new brand purpose, “The Possibilities are Beautiful”. This is a new articulation of our brand platform, celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty. We believe we’ve moved past the point of driving awareness of the concept of Ulta Beauty, All Things Beauty, All in One Place, to one of being able to create a true emotional connection with our current and prospective guests. This is how great brands create loyalty and drive growth over the long haul.To support the launch, we commissioned a consumer study to understand beauty standards and perceptions of beauty today, in order to facilitate this important discussion. We brought this to life with a partnership with NBCUniversal’s platforms, including NBC, E! and Telemundo, which garnered millions of impressions and engagement with our brand.As part of our efforts to connect more closely with the key consumer segments of millennials, Latinas, Gen Z and African-Americans, we’ve launched specific efforts to drive awareness with each group. For example, we’re partnering with ESSENCE and Girls United to increase academic potential, confidence in leadership of young women’s aged 12 to 17, and leveraging partnerships with influencers and media partners that are most relevant to these consumer groups.',
                 'USB': "I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.Jenn ThompsonThank you, Casey and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp’s third quarter results and to answer your questions.Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today’s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page two of today’s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.I'll now turn the call over to Andy.Andrew CecereGood morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be opening up the call to Q&A.Let me begin on slide three. In the third quarter, we reported record net income and earnings per share driven by record revenue and positive operating leverage. In line with our expectations, loan growth accelerated in the third quarter, supported by continued strength in consumer lending and a pickup in commercial loan growth.On the right side of slide three, you can see that credit quality improved in the third quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.3% from year ago. During the third quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Slide four highlights our best-in-class performance metrics including a 19.9% return on tangible common equity. Our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average common equity all improved sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.Terrance DolanThanks Andy. If you turn to slide five, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of earnings trends. Average loan grew 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis excluding the impact of a student loan portfolio sale in the second quarter.We saw continued growth in retail portfolios such as mortgage and retail leasing. Credit card loan growth was supported by expansion in both the number of active accounts and sales per active account.We are seeing good momentum in digital acquisitions across platforms. As expected, commercial loan growth accelerated in the third quarter following modest growth in the first half of the year. Pipelines remain strong and we are seeing CapEx investment and M&A activity among our corporate clients.Alternative funding sources such as the capital markets and companies own cash balances are limiting the clients' need to access the loan markets, but to a lesser extent, than during the last several quarters.As investment spending gains traction and companies worked through their cash balances and tax repatriation, we expect commercial loan growth to continue to improve. Consistent with the past several quarters, commercial real estate loans declined reflecting our decisions not to extend credit as unfavorable terms and continued pay downs as customers seek alternative financing.This quarter, excluding the impact of a student loan sale, commercial real estate contributed a 27 basis point drag to linked-quarter growth and a 122 basis point reduction to year-over-year loan growth. While pay down activity remains a headwind, it is gradually diminishing in intensity and we expect the trend to continue.Turning to slide six, deposits declined 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis. This included the impact of an anticipated balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client, which represents about half of the balance decline. This impact is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter.About half of our deposits are retail customer balances within our consumer and business banking business line where we saw a 0.7% linked-quarter increase in average deposits, driven by a 2.7% increase in non-interest-bearing deposits.Within corporate and commercial banking, our business customers are deploying the deposit balances to support growth and are migrating balances to alternative investment vehicles. This drove some of the decline this quarter.Additionally our corporate trust business saw seasonal declines in deposit balances associated with the timing of the receipt and distribution of funds. These deposit flows are consistent with our asset liability modeling expectations.Slide seven indicates that credit quality improved in the third quarter due to improving economic conditions with customer pay downs resulting in pressure on loan balances, but an improved credit profile. Notably our non-performing assets declined 8.0% compared with the second quarter and decreased 19.7% compared with the third quarter of 2017.",
                 'UAA': 'I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Lance AllegaThank you, and good morning to everyone joining us on today’s call today discuss Under Armour’s third quarter 2018 results. Participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning’s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning’s release. We use non-GAAP amounts as the lead in some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management’s view on why this information is useful to investors.Joining us on today’s call will be Under Armour, Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for questions.With that, I’ll turn it over to Kevin.Kevin PlankThanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone.On our call a year ago, I spoke about our story in the context of chapters, the early days going public and then getting big fast. In our get-big-fast period, we accomplished what we said out to do, gain the scale in innovation, product and global footprint necessary to show up in the consumer consideration set of the world’s best athletic brands. Following this rapid growth, over the past two years of our transformation, we’ve been laser-focused on driving greater structural, financial and operational efficiencies.Two years that have served as one of the most challenging yet productive and opportunistic times in our history. During this tenure, we have executed against a number of strategic initiatives to better ourselves as a company and as a brand. To highlight some of these efforts, I would start with our restructuring plans, which we’ve used to close underperforming facilities and retail locations, exit certain sports marketing contracts, optimize our global workforce and aggressively clear challenged inventories.In our supply chain, we shortened lead times, are executing against our global vendor consolidation, substantially reduced our inventory levels, and are continuing to increase our distribution efficiencies. Within our product category and merchandising teams, we have aligned calendars across all functions, removed a significant number of SKUs, styles, trims, lessened materials, shortened our overall go-to-market calendar by four to five months, and streamlined our category structure.Within marketing, digital and IT, we are improving our global CRM, utilizing ROMI or return on marketing investment to employ assets with the highest rates of return, updating our global ERP with our partners at SAP, and continuing to commercialize the intersection of our digital, fitness, e-commerce and social media platforms.And within our financial organization, efforts around smart spend, zero-based budgeting, and more efficient SG&A productivity continue to install high level of discipline across our Company.These efforts demonstrate the holistic approach we’re engaging in this transformation, yet this isn’t a cost-cutting exercise, which is why we are being methodical and measured about this execution. It takes time; and by design, it’s purposeful. An evolution that is geared at producing smarter, brand-right decisions to generate consistent results through repeatable processes that ultimately drive greater shareholder returns, all the while ensuring that our brand remains coveted and desirable as we grow globally.Today’s third quarter results show just that, another solid proof point that our multiyear journey toward becoming a more operationally excellent Company is on track. As we work to close out the second year of this transformative chapter, as we work to protect this house, we are steadfast in the challenge of becoming better at every turn. And as we continue attacking the dimensions of our strategic pillars, product, story, service and team, our foundation has become stronger, and our ability to execute more successfully is gaining momentum. Momentum, momentum is an essential asset to this transformation because we never stopped. We never stopped innovating better products, we never stopped cultivating powerful consumer connections, we never stopped identifying ways to be a better retail partner; and we’ve never stopped evolving our culture as a team. This momentum is the very fuel that drives our reasons for being, to make you better by delivering performance solutions you never knew you needed and can’t imagine living without. This is Under Armour. And as I look to the future, I’ve never been more energized, confident and excited about what is ahead for us, both as a brand as an operator.',
                 'UNP': "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific.Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.Thank you, and good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Tom Lischer, Executive Vice-President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018 or $2.15 a share. This represents an increase of 33% of net income and 43% in earnings per share when compared to 2017. This was an all-time quarterly record for Union Pacific even without the benefit from corporate tax reform.Total volume increased 6% in the quarter compared to 2017. Premium and Industrial carloadings both increased 9%, while Agricultural Products grew 2% and Energy volumes were down 2%. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.7% which was flat with the third quarter of 2017. Higher fuel prices had a 0.3 negative impact on the operating ratio.Strong top-line growth was offset by an increase in volume-related costs, higher spending due to some lingering network inefficiencies and other cost hurdles. While we've reported solid financial results, we did not make the service and productivity gains that we had expected during the quarter. However, we believe that Unified Plan 2020 along with other G55 and Zero initiatives and recent changes to our leadership team, position us well to start driving larger service and operational improvements going forward.We launched Unified Plan 2020 on October 1 in our Mid-American corridor with the goal of creating more streamlined operations on the eastern one-third of our network. While early, I am pleased with the initial results, as we have seen improvement in several key performance indicators on our network.We've also made a number of other changes to drive near-term productivity savings that you will hear about today from the rest of the team. Our entire Union Pacific team is fully engaged in the implementation of Unified Plan 2020 and our pursuit of running a highly-reliable, more efficient network. There is much more to come as we continue to roll-out Unified Plan 2020 across our network, and I'm excited about the opportunities it's going to create for both our customers and our shareholders.I'm confident we have the right people and the right plans in place to improve our operations, to provide more reliable service for our customers and achieve industry-leading financial performance. The team will give you more of the details on the third quarter and Unified Plan 2020 starting with Ken.Kenny Rocker - Union Pacific Corp.Thank you, Lance and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was up 6% driven by strength in our Premium, Industrial and Agricultural business groups with the partial offset in Energy. We generated positive net core pricing of 1.75% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal and international intermodal markets. The increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 10% increase in freight revenue. So now, let's take a closer look at the performance in each business group.Ag Products revenue was up 6% on a 2% increase in volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were up 2% driven by strong exports, predominantly shipping to Mexico, coupled with increased domestic demand resulting from lower corn prices. These gains were partially offset by persistent weakness in wheat due to reduced U.S. competitiveness in the world market exports.Grain products carloads were up 6%, driven by sustained demand for ethanol and other bio fuels. This renewable fuel strength, coupled with increased meat production, also drove an increase in shipments for animal proteins. Fertilizer carloads were up 5% due primarily to continued strength in export potash.Energy revenue increased 1% for the third quarter as a 2% decrease in volume was offset by a 2% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume was down 3% primarily driven by contract loss and retirements, coupled with lower natural gas prices which fell 3% versus the third quarter 2017. Sand carloads were down 23% due to the impact of regional sand and market decline in the Permian Basin. Furthermore, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments which was the primary driver for the 40% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter.Industrial revenue was up 13% on a 9% increase in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 10% primarily driven by strong market demand for rock and cement and favorable year-over-year comps due to Hurricane Harvey that impacted the Texas Gulf in the third quarter of 2017. Likewise, plastics carloads increased 14% due to the same favorable third quarter comps resulting from the hurricane and strength in polyethylene shipments with increased production. Industrial chemicals volume increased 14% due to the continued industrial production growth.Premium revenue was up 18% with a 9% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 7% driven by continued demand for tight truck capacity and strength in parcel and LTL shipments. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversion and production growth at key locations.International intermodal volume was up 12% as new ocean carrier business continue in the third quarter, coupled with strong import and export shipments. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% due to strong truck and SUV sales, increased production at UP third plant and growth with new customer wins. Although the start was down 1% for the quarter, the light truck segment was up 7%.Looking ahead, for the rest of 2018, our Ag Products growth continues to face uncertainty in the export grain markets from foreign tariffs. However, we are seeing some positive indications in the market due to crop issues in South America and other countries, which has made U.S. grain more competitive in the world markets.We anticipate continued strength in biodiesel fuel and renewable diesel fuel shipments due to an increase in market demand for renewable fuels. We also expect tight truck capacity combined with the value of rail to continue our penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and beverage business.For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spread to drive positive results for petroleum products, but tough year-over-year frac sand comparisons coupled with local sand supply and softer market conditions will impact sand volumes. We also expect coal to experience continued headwind for the remainder of the year, and as always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand.For Industrial, we anticipate upside in plastics as production rates increase. Metal shipments are expected to grow due to strong construction in energy markets coupled with tight truck capacity. In addition, we anticipate continued strength in industrial production which drives growth in several commodities.For Premium, over-the-road conversions from continued tight truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic intermodal and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate growth year-over-year for the remainder of the year resulting from new business wins. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 17 million units, down 1% from 2017. However, production shifts and new import business will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand.So, before I turn it over to Tom for his operations update, I'd like to share a few observations on the progress we are making commercially as we put Unified Plan 2020 into action. We are working very closely with customers to lower our car inventory levels and remove excess cars from the network. This includes both private and system equipment. In the near-term, we plan to make adjustments to our advertorial charges to incentivize greater car and asset utilization across both our carload and unit train networks. More importantly, we are and we will continue to critically evaluate every carload on our network to determine if it fits into our operating strategy at the right margin.",
                 'UAL': 'I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mike Leskinen, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Michael LeskinenThank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday’s release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company’s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, and others in the room available to assist with Q&A.And now I’d like to turn over the call to Oscar.Oscar MunozThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected to have our decision on who’s best to fill our CFO seat by – sometime by today. We found someone obviously who strike the not only right balance of experience, financial acumen and leadership and has been part of the team all along, Gerry Laderman. So we’re excited to have him in the seat.As I think about the quarter, we executed another outstanding quarter, marked by strong financial results and I think lots of momentum. Like I like to say and I said before, it is about proof, not just promise, and we delivered financial results at the high end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance once again in this quarter. Now this is because of the hard work and dedication of our employees, and they continue to find absolutely new ways to meet and exceed the expectations from not only you, our shareholders, but of course, our customers.A quick recap of the financials. Turning to Slide 4. Yesterday, we reported third quarter adjusted pretax earnings of $1.1 billion with an adjusted pretax margin of 9.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 was 36% higher than last year. We did recapture about 100% of the year-over-year increase in fuel through a balance of revenue and cost control. These results are tremendous and are indicative of the strides we’ve made on our revenue, operational growth initiatives, customer service, all of the initiatives, which continue to run ahead of the expectations we’ve established for ourselves.In fact, Scott will highlight that we realized the strongest PRASM growth in the third quarter in our mid-continent hubs, which also has the highest levels of capacity growth in the quarter, as we laid out to you in January. Looking into the future, we’re sharpening and continuing our focus on our customers. I’d like to give you a few – maybe four examples here of the actions we took just in this last quarter that I think are beginning to separate us from the competition. They’re only part of what makes us uniquely United.So first, we know from customer feedback the boarding process has long been an area with room for improvement. After collecting significant feedback from employees and customers around the globe, we rolled out a better boarding process across our system. Better boarding, that’s kind of our brand, means less time waiting in line, and importantly, improve communications with customers and overall a less stressful process for our customers and employees. Innovations like these have an important impact on customer satisfaction.',
                 'UNH': 'Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company’s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2018, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company’s Web site.I would now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.David WichmannGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we reported strong operating and financial results across our enterprise. Those results provide a sense of the capacity to advance growth within our businesses, capacities rooted in the breadth and adaptability of our business approach and above all in our mission helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone.Executing on this mission produces real value for the people we serve and for society in the U.S. and globally through higher quality healthcare delivery with better outcomes, at lower costs leading to improved consumer satisfaction. Executing on our mission also produces steadily advancing growth and financial value.Third quarter revenues grew 12% to $56.6 billion, and third quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 28% to $3.41. We now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share to approach $12.80, growth of about 27%. This increases our outlook by $0.17 [ph] per share from the midpoint of our range last quarter.These results are grounded and persistently applying three core competencies; information, technology, and clinical insights across our businesses. At no time in our history has our work in these three competencies held more promise than today as they powerfully combine to unlock healthcare value for those we serve.We organize and align data both clinical and administrative around the healthcare consumer using proprietary tools and technologies which evaluate data and care patterns against evidence-based guidelines. Pairing highly personalized data and best known science, we offer next best action for consumers while providing them full transparency into the quality and cost of services offered by their local health systems.We engage our own clinical care resources as well to directly support consumers’ individual healthcare needs. We further use data to improve compliance with evidence-based medicine raising overall satisfaction with care and reducing unnecessary resource consumption. We increasingly do this through employed and affiliated integrated care teams, and in more ambulatory care settings sharing this knowledge at critical points of decision making.Building and applying these competencies persistently to serve each individual we touch, the broader communities and societies we are part of, and you our shareholders requires thoughtful continuing investment internally and in alignment with others through well-developed research and development, venture, and M&A capacities.You can see the broad impact of these competencies in each of our five growth pillars. In care delivery, we use data analytics in concert with our knowledge of local market clinical performance to get patients to the best doctors, care pathways, and sites of service for particular conditions, and to inform development of value-based care arrangements for our employed and affiliated-care providers. Increasingly, these are shared risks and performed-based relationships.In consumer-centric health benefits, information is powering modern product designs to fortify performance networks, tools, and incentive programs to advance quality and engagement improving appropriate consumer access while reducing the cost of healthcare. Specific examples include our new on-demand healthcare and Colorado Doctors Plan offerings and our designs for the duly eligible and Medicare advantage participants. All of these hold promise for continued growth across our benefits businesses.You see it in pharmacy-care services where we have integrated medical and pharmacy information and provide point-of-care technologies to simplify administration, improve drug selection and adherence, and reduce not only pharmacy costs but medical care costs as well, all increasingly within the clinical workflow of doctors.You see it in digital health where our consumer digital health platform Rally is now serving over 20 million registered users. Rally is synthesizing information and engaging people to better manage their health, helping consumers save money by selecting the highest quality care providers, understanding their out-of-pocket costs upfront, and in some markets even scheduling appointments for care. We will soon be releasing at scale, a first-of-kind fully integrated and fully portable individual health record that delivers personalized next best health actions to people and their caregivers.And finally in global healthcare, we are bringing payment integrity analytics and network and product innovations to key private healthcare markets in South America in support of both our health benefits businesses as well as our extensive care delivery operations. These are just a few examples of how we deploy these core competencies in our businesses. Taken more broadly, they give you a sense of UnitedHealth Group’s potential to drive distinctive, constructive change, sustained growth and performance for those we serve.',
                 'UPS': "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.Scott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.Good morning and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Richard Peretz, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, Jim Barber, Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer.Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements, and address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of our company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.During the quarter, UPS recorded a pre-tax charge of $97 million. The charge resulted primarily from transformation-related activities. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Unless stated otherwise, today's financial discussion will refer to adjusted results. Webcast users can submit live questions during today's call. We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.Thank you. And now I would turn the call over to David.David P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to provide an update on our results, our core business strategies and to reinforce our optimistic outlook for the business. We've had another productive quarter of continued growth with solid margins and strong free cash flow. In a moment I will discuss our progress on transformation and core business strategies.First, I'll provide a brief summary of the quarter's highlights which show positive and sustained momentum. The U.S. Domestic segment produced strong yield improvement as the initial impact of our disciplined pricing and improved customer mix lifted our performance. We continued to incur near-term expenses for the extensive upgrade to our U.S. network where we are opening a record amount of new highly automated capacity.The International segment in Q3 of this year generated higher revenue even on top of last year's exceptional growth level. Margins remained at industry-leading levels and we recorded our second highest Q3 operating profit ever, even with commodity headwinds and changing trade policy.Finally, the Supply Chain & Freight unit continued to deliver strong performance. These businesses benefit from revenue diversification, focused growth strategies and profitable market share gains, each contributed to the record segment results this quarter.As a reminder, we're using a structured transformation process to free up resources in order to enable and speed execution of three transformative business strategies. First generating higher quality revenue and improved customer and volume mix. We are focusing on growth with B2B customers in the most attractive market segments like SMBs, healthcare, e-commerce and high-growth economies.Second, using technology to increase efficiency in our global network operations and support staffs. And third, instilling a culture of continuous transformation to adopt new ideas, processes and speed our progress. We are driven to increase operating leverage across the enterprise in order to generate higher EPS and shareholder value. We made solid progress on transformation execution and our core strategies this quarter.First, in areas of revenue quality and mix, specifically growth in the e-commerce and SMB markets, we launched Ware2Go. Ware2Go is a UPS-owned business built on an innovative digital platform that will increase customer demand for two-day premium services. Ware2Go helps customers achieve the time-in-transit expectations in the markets by locating merchandise and fulfillment in the right warehouses around the country. This is also a good example of our cultural changes. We increased our speed to market by using an agile development process with the entire business conceived and launched in less than a year.Another tech-enabled revenue quality initiative is the recently announced global expansion of UPS My Choice to 112 countries, up from 16. This is an important milestone in strengthening our value proposition in emerging and high-growth markets, another one of our four strategic growth areas.We have 52 million UPS My Choice members and we are adding a new member every 4 seconds. The global expansion will accelerate total membership and enhanced value in the platform. We will deploy a version of this platform fine-tuned for business customers in early 2019. We believe it will further enhance UPS' attractiveness to customers of all sizes.",

You should also note that the company’s press release, investor presentation and today’s call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Please refer to the back of the company's recent investor presentations to see the reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; Jessica Graziano, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, President and Chief Operating Officer.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.Mike KneelandGood morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As you know, we often start these calls by talking about profitable growth. And today we have another strong quarter to discuss. We have measured our performance in concrete ways including our ability to get attractive margins and returns.In the third quarter, we achieved both of these objectives with results that were solidly rooted in a sustainable advantages such as fleet management, vertical strategies and productive gains as well as an effective strategy for M&A.Our acquisition of NES and Neff are still young but they are already returning good value for our shareholders. And then, Baker integration is going well as you will hear later in the call.Underpinning these initiatives is a robust endurable cycle that continues to propel industry growth. And it is important to note that we are outperforming both the U.S. equipment rental industry and the construction marketplace both of which are estimated to be growing in the mid single digits.By comparison, our pro forma rental revenue in the quarter increased by almost 11%. Let me mark this morning will be followed by Matt, who will talk about our operating landscape and by Jessica who took the reins as our CFO last week.Now turning to the third quarter results. Both total revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased significantly in the quarter. And our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 20 basis points to 50%. Now, if we exclude the impact of Baker, we are up 80 basis points to 50.6% which would have been the highest margin in any quarter in our history.Looking at the underlying drivers, we had 7.4% increase in pro forma volume of equipment rental year-over-year and a healthy 2.1% increase in rental rates with gains across all 15 regions for both the quarter as a whole for each month individually. And we are growing our rate sequentially every month since March and the key point is that we have been able to convert these higher rates into stronger improvements in margin.The third quarter metric time utilization was 70.9% in the quarter, this was essentially unchanged from a year ago on a pro forma basis even though we had a spike in last September from the Hurricanes. So overall, remaining time utilization in the core business in a very high level.And as you saw in our press release, our underlying metrics did their job in driving returns and they point to consistently strong customer demand. Given these positive dynamics, we raised our guidance yesterday for full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CapEx. Our new outlook is based solely on our belief that we will outperform our earlier expectations of revenue and adjusted EBITDA.As for BlueLine, Jessica will give you the expected impact separately in her remarks. So operationally, we are well positioned to manage that growth. We built a powerful engine for organic expansion and for simulating future M&A. The discipline is that we even still through technology, process improvements and our safety culture have kept our priorities right in center while smoothing the way for acquired operations.In the third quarter, even with the integration underway, our team turned into excellent safety record. Our recordable rate in September was 0.74 and our rate for the year remains well below 1. So I applaud all of the employees for that.",
                 'UTX': "Please note, except or otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-reoccurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.In addition, in connection with the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a prospectus from UTC and a proxy statement from Rockwell Collins, which is effective, and which contains important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, the transaction and related matters.Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.Greg HayesOkay. Thank you, Kristy, and good morning everyone. As you all saw from our press release this morning, Q3 was another really solid quarter for UTC. EPS was $1.93. That's up 12% versus last year, and that's continuing the strong performance we saw in the first-half of 2018.I think importantly, organic sales were up 8%. That's our best quarter since 2011. We're clearly seeing the results from our investments and innovation that we've made across the business and from our leading positions in very strong end markets. So, based on our year-to-date performance and the continued strength in aerospace, we're getting to raise our outlook for 2018, and we now expect EPS in the range of $7.20 to $7.30. That's versus our prior outlook of $7.10 to $7.25. We're also improving the low-end of the sales outlook by about $500 billion. We now expect revenues of 64% to 64.5%, and that would take organic growth to 6%, that's up from our prior expectation of 5% to 6%. So, again, really strong top-line as the markets continue to show further growth.Before we go any further, just a couple of comments on Rockwell Collins; regarding the timing of the close of the transaction, as you know, we received the Department of Justice approval, a U.S. DOJ approval on about October 1. That's later than what we had anticipated. If you'll recall, we had hoped to see that some time early to mid-September, it was a little bit later, and as a result, it has pushed out the Chinese approval date. We'd always expected, and I think I said this back in September, that it'll be a few weeks after the U.S. DOJ approval that we would expect China to also grant their approval. So, bottom line, we're still within our expected timing range for China. We don't see any drama here, and we continue to expect this to happen shortly.As far as the portfolio discussions, as I've said before, the Board has continued its deliberations on the strategic questions regarding the portfolio, and I mentioned back in September, probably within about 60 days, which would be mid-November, and I still think we're right along that timeline that we had talked about, about a month or so ago.Okay, back to the business results and some outlook. We're keeping a close eye on the global economy in light of -- well, it's the geopolitical environment that is our biggest concern. To date, our end markets of course continue to be very strong, and growth forecasts for the global economy remain strong through next year. On the aerospace side, we're seeing particular strength. Military programs continue to ramp up, we're also seeing signs of recovery in the bizjet segments. On the commercial side, global air traffic remains robust. Year-to-date, revenue passenger miles are up about 6.8% globally, and in July, the global passenger load factor reached an all-time high of 85.2%. We're seeing these aerospace fundamentals translate of course into continued strong demand at both Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business.On our commercial building side, construction activity in the U.S. remained strong, as does infrastructure activity in China. And driving the strength in our orders is, of course, the growing economy and the urbanization rates, which continue to be strong throughout Asia. As always, of course, there're some things that we're monitoring; tariffs, logistics costs, exchange rates, those all remain watch items, specifically on tariffs, no change to our previously-discussed expectation of about a $0.05 headwind in 2018. As we look at 2019, as the tariffs remain in place, we see about a $0.15 incremental headwind. However, it's still early in the process. We continue to look for ways to mitigate the impact of the tariffs as we move forward. And as you see, we've been able to offset most of the tariff impact this year. We'll work to do the same next year. As always, we stay focused on what we can control, and we're confident in the investments that we've made that'll position each business for a sustainable long-term growth. And that positions us to remain a leader in each of our end markets.",
                 'UHS': "Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference.Steve Filton Thank you, Jessa. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to walk this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, our reported net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2018 was $171.7 million or $1.84 per diluted share as compared to $141.2 million or $1.47 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2017. As calculated on the Supplemental Schedule, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS was during the third quarter of 2018 was $200.8 million or $2.23 per diluted share as compared to $143.4 million or $1.49 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year. Excluded from our adjusted net income during the third quarter of 2018 was an unfavorable after-tax impact of $37.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share substantially all of which related to an increase in the reserve recorded in connection with our ongoing discussions with the Department of Justice as discussed in our press release. On a same-facility basis, in our Acute division, revenues during the third quarter of 2018 increased 6.7% over last year's comparable quarter. Excluding the health plan, same-facility revenues increased 8.1%. The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 1.5% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.6% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 2.5% during the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the third quarter of 2017. During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our Behavioral Health facilities owned for more than a year increased 4.7% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%. Revenue per adjusted admission decreased 1.9% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.1% during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter.Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2018, we are narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.25 to $9.60 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $9.25 to $9.90 per diluted share. This provides estimated guidance range which excludes the favorable impact of the reserve established in the unfavorable impact of the reserve established in connection with the civil aspects of the government’s investigation of certain of our Behavioral facilities and also excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09 decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 3% while the lower end of the range remains unchanged. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $975 million from $879 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2017. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to 53 days during the third quarter of 2017. At September 30, 2018, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization declined to 42.9% as compared to 45.4% at September 30, 2017.We spent $151 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2018 and $521 million during the first nine months of 2018. Year-to-date, we have added 76 new acute care beds and 313 new beds to our busiest Behavioral Health hospitals. In addition, earlier this month, we opened the 100 bed Inland Northwest Behavioral Health Hospital a joint venture with Provident Health in Spokane, Washington and next week plan to open the 80 bed Palm Point Behavioral Health Hospital in Titusville, Florida. Our behavioral health integrations, joint venture pipeline is very strong and robust with over 30 active discussions. In conjunction with our stock repurchase program, during the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 940,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $118 million or approximately $125 per share. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2018, we’ve repurchased approximately 9.45 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.09 billion or approximately $115 per share.",
                 'UNM': "Tom WhiteGreat. Thank you, Shelly. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call for Unum.Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.Our SEC filings can be found in the Investor section of our website.I remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. And a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website in the Investors section.Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum 's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; CFO, Jack McGarry; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US; Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK; Tim Arnold for Colonial Life; and Steve Zabel for the Closed Block.And now, I'll turn the call over to Rick for his comments.Rick McKenneyThank you Tom and good morning everyone. The third quarter of 2018 was both a strong and pivotal quarter for the company. Earlier in the quarter we released the results of our long-term care review, which have now been incorporated in our financial results. More importantly, our core businesses continue to deliver strong premium growth and strong margins. In our market of employee benefits, the operating environment remains very good for us as the economy continues to perform well. A tighter labor market means full employment and wage inflation, both of which continue to provide more potential customers and increase the need for the financial protections that we provide. A stronger economy may also see higher interest rates, which is a real plus for our business. Overall, it was a good quarter and we are building momentum moving forward.As I mentioned in the third quarter results we reported yesterday afternoon, included the impact of the reserve addition to our long-term care business that we pre-announced back in mid-September. There were no material changes from that review. Adjusting for that, as well as for net realized investment gain in the quarter, our adjusted after tax operating earnings were just over $300 million, an increase of 22% over the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings per share were a $1.37 in the third quarter, an increase of just under 26%, compared to the third quarter of last year’s $1.09.Well, we will continue to address the long-term care block and update you on its trends as they evolve over time. We are very focused on the positive, underlying trends we are seeing in our core business operations and the consistent financial results they're generating. Here are a few points I'd like to highlight on the performance this quarter. First, premium growth for our core business segments remains favorable, increasing 6% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. This growth is being generated by a number of encouraging trends, including strong persistency, in our Unum US business, excellent sales momentum in Colonial Life, and disciplined management of rate increases on in-force business in Unum UK.Next, we continue to see generally consistent benefits experience across the core business segments, particularly in our Unum US and Colonial Life business lines. Benefits experienced at our UK business has been more volatile recently, but our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing in our key U.S. and UK business segments continue to generate consistent results.We also continue to see stable to improving expense ratios for the business segments through the active management of expenses and the benefits of investments that we have made. And continue to make – to improve the customer experience.With these strong operating trends, we continue to see excellent profit margins and returns for our core segments, which in turn drive significant financial flexibility for the company. This financial flexibility allows us to invest in the growth of our business, both organically and through the expansion of our footprint, such as with Pramerica Życie, acquisition that we closed in early October. This financial flexibility also enables us to effectively manage the legacy long-term care block with reserve in capital updates as appropriate, as well as investing in the internal resources and talent to effectively manage this complex block.",
                 'VFC': 'I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations for VF Corporation. Thank you. You may begin.Joe AlkireGood morning, and welcome to VF Corporation’s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Participants on today’s call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today’s call will be on an adjusted basis, which we define in the press release that we issued this morning. We use adjusted amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the company completed the sale of its Nautica brand business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. And in conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the company has included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations through their respective dates of sale.Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today’s call are based on continuing operations. Joining me on today’s call will be VF’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for questions. Steve?Steve RendleThank you, Joe. Good morning everyone. VF second quarter results were strong, fueled by the continued acceleration in our core brands and platforms. Our focus in investment in support of 2021 strategy is driving accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio. Over the past few months, geopolitical and macroeconomic events have caused increased volatility in the marketplace. I’d like to take a moment and address how a few of these events are shaping how we think about our business and our consumers.First, as it relates to the current trade climate between the U.S. and China. We are closely monitoring the situation and are actively involved in scenario planning. For context, about 11% of VF’s total cost of goods sold come directly to the U.S. from China. By leveraging our global supply chain, we have positioned ourselves to address any additional changes in the overall trade environment with China. And we have the ability to reposition our global sourcing footprint in the near to midterm to mitigate the potential negative impact of additional tariffs should they materialize.Second, with regards to the recent trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, we are pleased with the outcome. For VF, we’ve retained the most significant benefits we’ve enjoyed through NAFTA, and the impact to our business is expected to be minimal. And finally, this week, one of our U.S. customers filed for bankruptcy. As a reminder, the 2021 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day in Boston contemplated ongoing industry consolidation and customer bankruptcies in the U.S. market.So while the customer bankruptcies pressure our results in the short term, there is no impact to the long-term growth outlook for any of our brands. Regarding the consumer, above-average GDP growth, low unemployment and multiyear highs in consumer sentiment are driving strong results in the U.S. market. In China, consumer spending in footwear and apparel remains solid, thus far unfazed by geopolitical rhetoric. And while the performance of our European business has been slightly more volatile the past few months due in part to unusual weather patterns across the continent, we have not seen a meaningful change in the trajectory of our business.Let’s review a few highlights from our second quarter. Revenue increased 6% on an organic basis or 7% excluding the impact of FX as our growth engines continue to fuel our results. Our big three brands grew to combined rate of 11%, with our Vans brand delivering another exceptional quarter, up 26%. Vans revenue growth was strong across all regions, channels and product categories. And importantly, growth also remains well diversified. Last month, Vans hosted an Investor Day at the brand’s headquarters in Southern California where brand leaders outlined the path to $5 billion of revenue by 2023, representing a five-year CAGR between 10% and 12%.',
                 'VLO': "And I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin.John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of Valero's senior management team.If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, its says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We had solid safety and operational performance in the third quarter. Refinery utilization exceeded 99% and we set a new record for light sweet crude processing as discounts relative to Brent remained very attractive. We also delivered strong financial results outperforming the third quarter of last year despite a margin environment that was generally less favorable.Our use of the Diamond Pipeline and Enbridge Line 9B again contributed meaningfully to the performance of our Memphis and Quebec City Refineries, as these pipelines provided access to discounted Cushing and Canadian sweet crudes respectively. We look forward to the startup of the Sunrise Pipeline expansion, which is scheduled for November 1. This pipeline will add another 100,000 barrels per day of Permian pricing exposure to our Mid-Continent refineries and displays an equal volume of less competitively priced crude.We continued to deliver on our commitments to grow Valero's earnings capability through growth investments and acquisitions, while delivering returns to stockholders. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion was completed in August, bringing the current renewable diesel production capacity to 16,500 barrels per day. Development continues on a project to add a parallel facility and further expand the production capacity to a total of 44,000 barrels per day. A final investment decision is expected before year end.In September, our board of directors approved a project to construct a 55,000 barrel per day coker and a sulfur recovery unit at the Port Arthur refinery for a total cost of $975 million. Upon completion in 2022, the refinery will have two parallel crude vacuum coker trains. The additional coker capacity is expected to improve turnaround efficiency and provide margin benefits from increased heavy solid crude processing capability and reduce intermediate feedstock purchases.Earlier this month, we agreed to acquire three ethanol plants from Green Plains with a total nameplate capacity of 280 million gallons per year at a cost of $300 million, plus working capital estimated at $28 million. These plants utilize ICM and Delta-T technologies that are located in the corn belt, enabling us to transfer best practices from our existing portfolio and capture commercial and operational synergies. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash and anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and possible FTC review.Construction of the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal remains on track and work continues to progress on the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration plant. These projects are scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2020.Moving to Valero Energy Partners, we announced last week the execution of a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP at a price of $42.25 per unit. The transaction is expected to close as soon as possible after meeting customary closing conditions. Given the paradigm shift underway in MLP markets, Valero evaluated a range of options before the partnership and Valero concluded that a merger would provide the best outcome for Valero shareholders and VLP unit holders.This transaction offers compelling benefits for Valero shareholders in terms of cash flow synergies in a simplified structure. At the same time, the merger addresses MLP investor sentiment that has shifted away from favoring the high distribution growth, an equity funded drop-down model to a model that favors slower distribution growth and self-funded organic growth. The merger also offers a premium to VLP's average trading prices and immediate conversion of VLP's equity to cash.Now, turning to cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 55% of our year-to-date adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and we continue to target an annual payout ratio of between 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.",
                 'VAR': "Now, I will turn it over to J. Michael Bruff, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.J. Michael Bruff - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Varian's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining me today on the call are Varian's President and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Bischoping. Dow will share his thoughts on our results and our long-term strategy, and Gary will cover our operating and financial results in more detail.On the Varian Investor Relations website, you can find our fiscal third quarter press release and web deck, which are intended to provide additional perspective and details. Included in these documents is the reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We report non-GAAP earnings to provide comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items.Unless otherwise stated, all financial results discussed are non-GAAP and from continuing operations, all growth rates are year-over-year and any references to orders are gross orders. All references to trailing 12 months refer to the trailing 12 months ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter.During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, this conference call, and our SEC filings. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.And with that, I'll turn it over to Dow.Dow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.Thanks, Mike, and good day, everyone. Today, I'll share the key milestones we achieved this past quarter and how they contributed to our long-term strategy. First, let me touch on our results.Total company revenues of $709 million increased 12%. Oncology revenues grew 18%, driven by our integrated platform with best-in-class hardware, software, and services. Revenues for our Particle Therapy business were $42 million.Operating earnings of $119 million or 16.9% of revenues grew 26%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 grew 4% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.04 grew 28%. GAAP earnings per share was impacted by acquisition-related expenses and an impairment charge related to the expected refinancing of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. Gary will discuss these in more detail.Cash flows from operations were $102 million, down 34%, due to a large cash receipt from the Georgia Proton Treatment Center in the prior-year period. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $347 million, up 29%.In terms of our long-term growth and value creation strategy, we made progress across our three growth initiatives. First, strengthening our leadership in radiation therapy. Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 7% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months ending in March 2018. Varian maintained its market leadership and worldwide share during that period.In our Oncology business, orders grew 11% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date, our worldwide net installed base is now 8,046 units growing 4% or 280 units. On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon, and have now taken 98 orders since our May 2017 launch including 17 new orders in the third quarter. Since launch, nearly 60% of orders worldwide have been incremental.We've also seen strong interest in the kilovoltage cone-beam CT option that we launched as part of Halcyon 2.0 at ASTRO in April. All of our – half of our orders in the quarter were for these new systems and approximately one-third of our previous orders are scheduled to be upgraded.On the software front, we continue to see strong demand and positive feedback for our software solutions. Software revenues grew 13% and the number of unique Varian software customers grew 6%. Customers continue to adopt Varian's new software solutions. For RapidPlan, the installed base grew over 80% and we took more orders for licenses this quarter than in any prior quarter since we launched the product several years ago.And for Eclipse, we have now taken orders for nearly 320 licenses for Eclipse MCO, our multi-criteria optimization treatment planning tool. This feature enables clinicians to quickly compare treatment plans and choose the optimal one, enhancing both efficiency and plan quality. Our services revenues grew 10% driven by our growing installed base and higher mix of newer machines which typically have a higher attach rate and contract value.In our Particle Therapy business, we did not take any new orders in the quarter. However, we've taken four proton orders over the trailing 12 months and our sales pipeline remained solid. We continue to make progress toward completing sites that are under construction announced last month, the installation of a Varian ProBeam cyclotron at University College Hospitals in London.",
                 'VTR': "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ryan Shannon, Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.Ryan ShannonThanks Irma.

Ventas expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations.Additional information about the factors that may affect the Company’s operations and results is included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Company’s other SEC filings.Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as well as the Company’s supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ventasreit.com.I will now turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the Company.Debra CafaroThank you, Ryan, and good morning to all of our shareholders and others participants, it's great to be with you on today's Ventas third quarter earnings call.I’m also delighted to be joined by members of our Ventas team to report on another solid quarter and to highlight our financial strength, our investment and growth, expanded pipeline and partnerships, and commitments and recognition to ESG. After Bob provides detailed insights into our financial results, we will be happy to answer your questions.Let me start with our results and full-year 2018 expectation. We're pleased to report normalized funds from operations of $0.99 per share this quarter to improve our full-year normalized FFO expectation and to confirm our same-store cash NOI expectations for the year.Turning now to our enterprise and capital allocation strategy, we continue to enhance the long-term durability of Ventas by following our differentiated and deliberate approach of investing in our future growth with top tier customers and extending and expanding our key partnership.First, this quarter and immediately following, we invested approximately a 100 million in attractive medical office building and outpatient facility with two key partners, Ardent and Pacific Medical. We also announce our pending acquisition of a premier independent senior living community, located in the appealing Battery Park neighborhood of downtown Manhattan, firmly establishing our leadership in the high-end senior living Manhattan market.Second, we extended our exclusive partnership with Pacific Medical or PMB for a further 10-year term. With almost 50 years of experience and outpacing facility development with key U.S. health systems, PMB's knowledge and expertise and development is extraordinary. The attractive MOB investments we made this quarter are an example of the benefits of our partnership with PMB. As is our trophy MOB development attached to Sutter, new flagship hospitals in downtown San Francisco, which is on track to open in early 2019.We're also happy to report on the great performance lease-up and delivery of our university based research and innovation centers. Our forward pipeline of excellent projects is robust and growing. In light of strong university demand, our leading market position and the positive risk reward investment profile of this project, we intend to ramp-up our investment activity in this space.The attractiveness of our university base development model was recently brought to light at a summit hosted by Ventas and our partner Wexford. The buzz among attendees was palpable as we brought together leaders from universities and academic medical centers to share ideas and discuss innovative approaches to achieving their strategic goals.Our partner Wexford is a trusted advisor, catering to university needs and enjoys an incredible track record and reputation for conceiving building leasing and delivering powerful knowledge communities on university campuses that supercharge research and innovation. We are proud to partner with these leading universities and Wexford and to fund and own these knowledge communities for the long-term.In this business, I would like to note that one of our newest research and innovation buildings at Penn just opened. This project which is on the precipice of already being 90% leased further builds out our footprint in the attractive U City submarket. The success of this project follows on the heels of another recently owned project at WashU's Cortex Innovation District, which we expect to be a 100% leased very shortly.",
                 'VRSN': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer.

VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards we will open the call for your questions.With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million.Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $151.7 million consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names.Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year-ago quarter.We now expect full-year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions.Beginning with 2019 guidance on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intent to provide guidance on quarterly net additions, this change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics.The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base which is updated twice per day will continue to be available on our website.As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business.Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall, and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure.As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement that is expected to be executed at closing.The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following receipt of such approval.We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar.",
                 'VRSK': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Brodbar. Ma'am, you may begin.Stacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.Thank you, Regina, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer.Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Lee, highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.Now I will turn the call over to Scott.Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.Good morning, everyone. It's good to be reporting another quarter where we can see strength in organic growth of our business across all our verticals. Excluding exceptional events in the third quarter of 2017 in the Insurance segment due to extreme weather and in the Financial Services segment due to a contract signing, the organic growth of our company was 7.5% in the quarter, consistent with our long-term model, and the profile of our growth is also reflecting our long-term model, in that it is balanced across all the verticals.I thought I would take a few minutes this morning to comment on the environment in which we do our work and the factors which interact with our results. Fundamentally, we are aligned with one of the most powerful movements in the economy, which is companies harnessing data analytics with even greater focus and investment. There is a new level of digitization of business operations that has become a necessity for companies in all the verticals we serve.While the notion of data as an asset has been around for a while, companies now are compelled to change the way they interact with their customers by becoming faster, more automated, more visual, and easier to use. These changes at the front-end of the business model require companies to rewire most everything behind the front-end as well. As businesses become more digital, they accumulate more data in real-time, and this causes them to become more analytic, given the decreased cost of ingesting and storing the data combined with improving data science.Against this backdrop, our ability to help our customers on the digitization journey, in combination with our unique datasets and deep domain knowledge, give us expanding opportunities to add value for our customers. The search for efficiency and insight from data analytics will only increase for our customers. As long as we remain close to our customers, hearing their emerging needs and responding with timely useful solutions that leverage our scale across industry participants, our value to our customers will grow. It is a positive thing for us that our customers are becoming more data analytic and hiring more data scientists. This increases their propensity to value the things we do.We are always alert to three risks. Is the regulatory environment changing? Is the structure of the verticals we serve changing? And, is the environment causing changes in the cost of doing business? On the one hand, the regulatory front has seen some change, but on the other hand there have been few changes that have materially impacted our business.One noteworthy move of the last several years has been more scrutiny in the banking sector, but the only effect has been our need to make some of our products more ready for reporting requirements, and that shift has already occurred. At the societal level, there has been movement toward more concern about data privacy, with approaches such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in Europe. The primary effect of this is to reinforce the diligence we've always brought to keeping our data assets secure.Although data analytics, innovation, and technology continue to evolve and increase in importance, the structure of our industry verticals is not changing to any material degree. In Insurance, the global reinsurers and brokers have seen some consolidation as they work to adjust to a world in which risk can be borne directly by the capital markets, but the bulk of our work is with primary insurers, and the reinsurers are being affected in modifying their businesses. And more generally, the effect of digitization is to reduce distribution advantages and fixed costs, both of which will lessen the incentive to combine companies for cost advantage.The environment carries two trends, which push our costs in opposite directions. On the people front, we are increasing the mix of our team, which comes from the hard core data science world. These folks are highly sought-after and paid accordingly. On the technical infrastructure front, the move toward cloud computing and away from premise computing will reduce our computing and storage costs. We are in the early stage of seeing these benefits.So, our overall perspective is that the basic conditions of our environment remain constructive. What it's down to, therefore, is the depth of our relationship with our customers, and the capability of our team to innovate solutions and make them work for our customers. In the past 30 days, I've visited with four CEOs of our leading customers. In every case, I came away with an enhanced sense of opportunity. As they take their businesses forward in a digitizing environment, their expressed preference is for a relatively short list of partners who can make sense of all the technical innovations and relate them to existing workflows. In such an environment, a trusted and tested partner like Verisk stands taller. As long as we continue to invest to keep our customers at the leading edge of innovation and do so with efficiency, we will realize value.",
                 'VZ': "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.Brady ConnorThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through.Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million.The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4.As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31.The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods.With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.Matthew EllisThank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology.In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders.Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company.In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment.Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings.",
                 'VRTX': "ntationMichael Partridge - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; and Ian Smith, Chief Operating Officer, will provide prepared remarks this evening. Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Chief Medical Officer, will join us for Q&A. We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call. This conference call is being recorded. A replay will be available on our website.We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements including, without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed CF medicines, the ongoing development and potential commercialization of our triple-combination regimen for cystic fibrosis, Vertex's other programs and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially.I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden.Jeffrey M. Leiden - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Thanks, Michael. Good evening everyone. I'm pleased to say that, we have made tremendous progress across our business in 2018 and are well on track to achieve the key goals that we outlined to start this year.In CF, approximately half of all patients are now eligible for a Vertex CF medicine and we're progressing rapidly toward the development of a single medicine to treat any CF patient with one or more F508del mutations, approximately 90% of all people with the disease.In our development pipeline, we have initiated the first clinical study of CTX001 in beta thalassemia with our partner CRISPR Therapeutics and are progressing VX-150 for the treatment of pain. And in research, we're preparing to advance the first of our potential medicines for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency into clinical development by year-end and to move other molecules into development in 2019.First, to our recent progress in cystic fibrosis. CF is a progressive multi organ disease with its presence from birth and a key part of our strategy is to treat patients as early as possible to slow or prevent the progression of disease. To that end, we gained important approvals throughout 2018 that now allow us to treat eligible children as young as one year of age with KALYDECO and as young as two years of age with ORKAMBI.With SYMDEKO demand continues to be strong following the U.S. approval in February. The launch of this medicine in the U.S. has been a significant driver of revenue growth in 2018 as new patients initiate treatment and we also plan to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA later this year to gain approval in eligible patients as young as six years of age. In Europe, we anticipate approval of this medicine before the end of this year, which will further increase the number of patients eligible to be treated with the medicine for the underlying cause of their disease.We've also reached multiple important reimbursement agreements across the world, to provide access to ORKAMBI, enabling patients in many countries to treat the underlying cause of the disease for the first time. Many of these agreements, including those recently signed in Denmark and Australia, also provide a pathway to access and rapid reimbursement for certain future CF medicines. Importantly, these portfolio agreements provide certainty to patients that they will have immediate access to future innovations in CF from Vertex. We remain in discussions regarding this type of agreement in other countries, but have yet to reimburse ORKAMBI.We're also rapidly progressing our two Phase 3 programs, evaluating two different triple combination regimens that include a next-generation corrector either VX-659 or VX-445. In September, we completed enrollment of the two Phase 3 studies for the VX-659 triple combination regimen and expect data from these studies in late 2018. We expect to complete enrollment for the VX-445 Phase 3 studies this quarter and to report data from these studies in the first quarter of 2019.We will evaluate data from both programs with the goal of choosing the best regimen to submit for regulatory approval. We remain on track to submit a new drug application for a triple combination regimen no later than mid-2019. In parallel, we've also recently initiated studies of both of our triple combination regimens in patients ages 6 to 11 years of age with the goal of gaining approval for this group of children as quickly as possible.We also continue to innovate in CF to develop even better regimens for the future, including potential once-daily triple combination regimens with our potentiator VX-561 and regimens to contain other next-generation correctors that may have enhanced profiles. We expect to advance one or more of these novel next-generation correctors into early clinical development in the coming months.Beyond CF, our research strategy is well-defined and focused on the development of transformational medicines for serious specialty diseases with large unmet medical need. And we're advancing a portfolio of such potential new medicines into the clinic. The diseases we are targeting all have well understood biology where we can use or create early clinical markers that support the potential for transformative benefit and rapid development timelines.",
                 'VIAB': "I will now turn the conference over to the presenters.James BombasseiGood morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements it involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.And now, I will turn the call over to Bob.Robert BakishThanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm pleased to update you on our progress to grow Viacom and position it for the future. When you look at what we achieved in Q3, and our momentum in Q4. I think you will clearly see that the Viacom turnaround is delivering demonstrable and measurable results. And you will also see how quickly we are evolving to be much more than a U.S. Pay-TV network company. In fact, through this combination of turnaround and evolution, we're setting Viacom up for success as a truly multi-platform, global brand and IP-driven entertainment company.Before I take you through a whole set of facts supporting this statement, let me first touch on some high level financials. Q3 represents our second consecutive quarter of adjusted diluted EPS growth and year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS is up 4%. Underlying that, we are reporting compelling improvements in domestic affiliate sales and worldwide ancillary revenues and strong profitability improvement at Paramount.Looking to the September quarter, we now project strong adjusted OI growth and double-digit growth in EPS. Wade will take you through the numbers in detail. But before he does, let’s focus on our operations where we’ve continued to execute on both the turnaround and the evolution of this company. As I speak to this, I’d encourage you to refer to our earnings presentation on our website, which tracks the discussion. I’ll start with four key areas that were clearly challenged when this management team took over. Notably U.S. distribution, the audience performance of our networks, the trajectory of U.S. ad sales and the state of Paramount Pictures. And in each, I’ll highlight just how dramatically the picture has changed for the better. First, our domestic affiliate business. A critical area that was considered a significant uncertainty 18 months ago, but now is a key turnaround story. By rebuilding and expanding our relationships with distribution partners, we closed major renewals, secured incremental carriage and broaden the scope of our partnerships to include advanced advertising and co-production deal. At the same time, we laid the groundwork for new areas of growth, including most recently securing carriage in the AT&T Watch entertainment only mobile bundle. We also participated in a funding round that ensures Pylo, [ph] an entertainment only OTT skinny bundle has the resources to drive its next leg of growth.Importantly, we also see improvement in Viacom Pay TV subscriber trends, with our sub declines now moderating to the mid-1% range. This driven by the full return of Viacom Networks to Charter and Suddenlink and continued vMVPD growth. All of these efforts delivered sequential domestic affiliate revenue improvement throughout fiscal 2018, including in Q3 and we now anticipate domestic affiliate revenue growth of 1% in Q4. Compelling evidence of just how far our turnaround has come in this critical area.The second area of turnaround is viewership on our domestic media networks. Here we have another strong story of continued improvement. In fact, Viacom flagship brands have now produced five straight quarters of year-over-year share growth, with particular strength at MTV, BET, and Comedy Central. 18 months ago, MTV was deemed by many, to be a network in decline and at risk of becoming culturally irrelevant.Well times have changed, if you haven’t been following this channel closely, here are a few key facts. Since last summer, the network has had four consecutive quarters of year-over-year primetime ratings growth, its best streak in seven years. While dramatically increasing its digital consumption.In fact, in Q3, MTV is the fastest growing network in Prime, across cable and broadcast, in its 18 to 34 target demo. And in 2018, it has launched 5 of the top 10 unscripted cable series with a mix of franchise IP, like Jersey Shore, International IP, like X on the Beach and new IP, like Siesta Key and Floribama Shore. Ad VH1, and we have 9 out of the top 10 unscripted series on cable this year. and it’s the top nine. All are reducing costs by an average of 30% per episode.",
                 'V': "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to our IR website.Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.Mike, thank you and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was 15% as all of our key economic drivers remained strong. The healthy global economic fundamentals we've seen in the past few quarters have largely continued.Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis of 11% accelerated modestly versus the prior quarter fueled by faster growth in almost every region and higher credit growth. Cross-border growth on a constant dollar basis of 10% decelerated by 1 percentage point versus the prior quarter largely due to the stronger dollar.Processed transaction growth was consistent with the last quarter at 12%. Expense growth adjusted for the U.S. litigation provision increase was 14% as we continue to invest in talent and deploying new capabilities in markets around the world. Adjusted EPS growth was 39%.We also returned approximately $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter consisting of almost $1.8 billion of share repurchases and nearly $500 million through dividends. Vasant will take you through our results and our full-year outlook in more detail when I complete my remarks.Regarding the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation or the MDL provision increase of $600 million this quarter, we continue to make progress in resolving this litigation and have reached an agreement in principle with the class seeking monetary damages. That agreement is subject to negotiation of a full written agreement and those negotiations are ongoing.Discussions with the class seeking injunctive relief are also ongoing. We will make an announcement related to any agreement if and when any settlement agreement is finalized.Now let me share updates from around the world starting with Europe. We continue to be very pleased with our performance in Europe and feel there is substantial runway for growth moving forward as the integration nears completion. We see significant opportunity over time across three broad tracks: the acceleration of payments volume growth, country-specific opportunities and increasing yield.First, we can accelerate our volume growth by displacing cash in key markets and increasing our share of domestic transactions. Cash still accounts for a sizable share of consumer spend in several of Europe's largest economies, such as approximately 60% in Spain, Italy, and Poland. Nine markets in Europe have an active or a large domestic card scheme, where we feel we have competitive advantages based on our innovative investments and digital capabilities.We're also enabling Fast Funds for Visa Direct driving contactless payments and working more closely with FinTechs on new and innovative offerings. This quarter we announced the FinTech fast-track access program to accelerate speed-to-market by onboarding FinTechs with Visa in four weeks.We also launched $100 million European investment program to support the FinTech ecosystem, building upon investments we've already made in companies like Klarna and solarisBank. Second, there are opportunities to gain share on specific markets within Europe as our current business is relatively concentrated. We plan to target faster growing markets and markets where we have lower share with investments in talent to support clients' innovative product solutions and enhanced marketing.Finally, there's opportunity to increase yields in Europe. First, we are focusing more on higher yielding consumer and commercial credit volumes. Prior to our acquisition, Visa Europe as an association was very debit-centric and did not focus much on credit; second, driving client adoption of value-added solutions, leveraging our global VisaNet platform capabilities, particularly our risk products, processing and services relevant in a PSD2 environment.",

Good morning, everyone. If I may, let me start by breaking a little bit. Our leasing numbers continue to be the best in the business. Year-to-date for three quarters across the entire business, including New York Office, Retail, theMART, and 555 California Street, our leasing activity totals over 2 million square feet and 179 leases with outstanding mark-to-markets of 33.8% GAAP and 24.1% cash. Thanks to Glen and our best in the business leasing team.Yesterday, we posted third quarter numbers. Here\'s the math. FFO as adjusted was $0.97 per share even with the prior year\'s third quarter. Our GAAP based as financial results for this quarter were negatively affected by $4.5 million, largely from non-cash, straight-line rent receivable write-offs. These GAAP accounting items did not affect our cash, our cash basis results. Remember, we run the business on cash numbers. Our third quarter cash basis FFO was adjusted with $0.95 per share, as compared to $0.89 per share for the prior year\'s third quarter up a strong 6.7%.This quarter\'s companywide cash basis NOI was $340.9 million, up 2.7% from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusting for the sale of our half interest in the 666 Fifth Avenue office condominium, the increase was an even greater 3.8%; more about 666 in a minute.Cash basis same-store NOI increased by 4.3%, comprised of New York office was up 5.1%, retail was up 4.2% benefiting by $4.9 million one-time real estate tax abatement catch up, with the total New York segment up 3.9%. theMART was up 2.2% and 555 California Street was up 19.9%. This quarter\'s leasing activity was robust, which David will cover in a minute.Our office business continues to perform very well. I\'ll say again what I\'ve said for the last several quarters, we are experiencing robust demand from all manner of industries in all of our submarkets. Our tenants are optimistic, aggressive, growing, and upbeat about New York.Everybody knows that I think our Penn Plaza assets are our main events. I have even called Penn Plaza the "Promised Land." Our transformation here will begin with Penn One and Penn Two, where we will create a two building 4.4 million square foot campus right on top of Penn Station. It will include a three block, Grant Plaza along Seventh Avenue covered by a giant new bustle across the entire 400 foot frontage of Penn Two. This plaza will stand out 70 feet from the building and will be 45 feet above the street. It will serve a dual purpose. It will be striking, creating a huge covered plaza in front of our Penn Two and the main entrance to Penn Station, and bring the neighborhood into the modern age. And at the same time, it will create a 140,000 square feet of very valuable new 220 foot high best-in-class creative space. Images of this design will be posted on our Web site tomorrow under the call sign www.vno.com/portfolio/development.',
                 'VMC': "And now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Director of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.Mark D. Warren - Vulcan Materials Co.Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.

You can find a reconciliation of these measures and other related information in both our earnings release and at the end of the supplemental presentation.Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?J. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company. I'm very pleased to have Suzanne Wood on the call today. Suzanne joined us as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in early September and has quickly proved to be a strong addition to our senior leadership team. Welcome, Suzanne.Let me get right to the notable things about the quarter. We saw strong Aggregates shipments underpinned by growing public demand, and in the face of bad weather, our operating disciplines were extremely good, and I'm proud of our peoples' execution. Aggregates pricing continue to march higher. This coupled with our disciplined cost control resulted in same-store unit profitability increasing 8% to $5.45 per ton.We achieved a 15% same-store increase in gross profit, while delivering same-store flow-through of incremental Aggregates revenue of 65%. The extreme bad weather we experienced was and is a short-term disruption. These disruptions have had no long-term impact on underlying demand, on pricing dynamics, or on flow-through of incremental revenue to gross profit. The third quarter bodes well for the future. Prices continue to escalate. With improved flow-throughs, all of which is supported by growing demand.Total revenues increased by 13%, reflecting growth in Aggregates volumes and Aggregates selling prices. All of this contribute to a 65% increase in net earnings and a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA. We obviously had extreme wet weather from – and flooding in the Carolinas and Virginia from Hurricane Florence and Tropical Storm Gordon caused record rain days in Dallas and San Antonio. We believe the severe weather negatively affected third quarter results with a loss of some2.5 million tons of Aggregates and related flooding costs. We estimate that the pre-tax loss due to weather to be approximately $27 million in the quarter.Now, I'd like to move on to the core drivers of profitability in the business, ex-weather. We continue to see growth in private demand, but we're really excited about the strengthening public sector. Highway construction demand is strengthening across the country, but much more so in our markets. We're now seeing the conversion of public funding in the shipments, and this showed up in 10% growth in our quarterly Aggregates shipments and a 6% on a same-store basis.While these are strong growth numbers, they're particularly strong given the severe weather we experienced. However, we are still below normalized demand levels, much less the next peak. As we've said all along this year, price increases will continue to climb throughout the year and throughout 2019. Average selling prices in the quarter, adjusted for mix, rose more than 3% on a year-over-year basis, and approximately 50 basis points over the second quarter.As we look at our booking pace and backlogs, we will continue to see good upward trends in pricing. Our discussions with customers on price increases for 2019 are encouraging. Our preliminary view is that the pricing will improve mid-single-digit in 2019, reflecting the positive momentum we're seeing today.Turning to same-store cost and flow-throughs, our freight-adjusted unit cost per sales declined 2%. This cost leverage and other operating efficiencies more than offset a 28% increase in diesel fuel and operating inefficiencies caused by bad weather. Again, we're very pleased with the way our operating discipline has enabled solid improvement in unit gross profit, despite difficult conditions.Regarding outlook for the fourth quarter, we would expect three things; one, shipment growth similar to that of the third quarter; two, prices to continue improving; and three, we expect the operating disciplines you saw in the third quarter to continue, allowing for over 60% flow-through, consistent with our long-term trends.Given what we accomplished in the third quarter and how things are going in the fourth quarter, we've set ourselves up well for 2019, and here is why. I am pleased with underlying demand growth and corresponding volume growth, driven by growing public demand in our markets. And as we approach 2019, our DOTs continue to pull tax revenues into job starts, which is translating into Aggregates shipments.Our backlogs and booking pace continue to grow. The fact that pricing and our backlog and bookings continues to increase along with positive 2019 fixed plant pricing conversations, gives us confidence in the continued accelerating pricing trends into 2019. The progress we made in our operating cost execution also reinforces our confidence in realizing continuous compounding improvements in unit margin, and 60% flow-throughs in 2019 and beyond.",
                 'WAB': "I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Tim Wesley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Wesley, the floor is yours, sir.Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our 2018 third quarter earnings call. Let me introduce the rest of our team here with me in Wilmerding; Ray Betler, President and CEO; Pat Dugan, our CFO; Stéphane Rambaud-Measson, our COO; our Corporate Controller, John Mastalerz; and Al Neupaver, our Executive Chairman.We're going to make our prepared remarks as we usually do and then we will be happy to take your questions. And of course, during the call, we will make forward-looking statements, so we just ask that you please review today's press release for the appropriate disclaimers.With that, I'll turn it over to you, Ray.Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. It's good to talk to you today. I'm happy to report, we have strong growth in sales and EPS for the third quarter and we're well-positioned for a strong finish to the year, both in terms of earnings and in terms of cash flow. We also affirmed our EPS guidance for the year and increased our sales guidance.In the third quarter, we saw year-on-year revenue growth in both our segments for the fourth quarter in a row. Even with strong revenue growth this year, adjusting for changes in FX, our backlog remains a record high. We won new business in most of our major markets and product areas around the world.As we focus on our short-term performance, we're also investing in our long-term growth opportunities, including, of course, our planned merger with GE Transportation, which we'll talk about those opportunities later in the call.But first, I wanted to introduce Pat to review the third quarter numbers.Patrick David Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.Thanks, Ray, and good morning, everybody. Sales for the third quarter were $1.08 billion. Our Transit segment sales increased 11% to $686 million. This increase was due to strong organic growth, adding about $51 million from acquisitions, which contributed about $21 million and those more than offset the negative impacts of foreign exchange rates of about $14 million. This is the fourth quarter in a row we've seen organic sales growth, which shows that our backlog is really starting to kick-in.Freight sales increased 15% to $392 million, the fourth year-on-year increase in a row. The increase was also due to strong organic growth, adding about $46 million and from acquisitions contributing about $11 million and that was offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange of about $6 million. Freight sales and backlog are near their highest levels in two years and Freight aftermarket sales showed year-on-year growth for the fifth quarter in a row, all of these are positive indicators.When you look at our consolidated operating income for the quarter, it was $125 million or 11.6% of sales. Now this operating income included transaction costs related to the GE Transportation merger of about $7 million. It included restructuring expenses of about $3 million and included about $1 million for a goods and service tax law change in India, which is reflected in our SG&A. Excluding those items, our operating margin was 12.6%. That's the same as the second quarter, despite a 3% decrease in sales consistent with seasonality.During the quarter, we also had a negative impact of about $2 million, due to tariff increases, which we were able to offset a portion of with surcharges or other adjustments. Our full-year 2018, adjusted operating margin target is now about 13%, slightly lower than our initial guidance, due to the tariffs and as we continue to work through some of our lower-margin contracts we're executing on in the UK.SG&A for the quarter was about $147 million. This increase is mainly due to the expense items, I've just mentioned and acquisitions. We expect it to be about $140 million in the fourth quarter, excluding any expenses related to the GE Transportation merger and any restructuring.Engineering expenses decreased to $20 million due to the timing of our spending and because some of those expenses do get captured in cost of sales as a component of our revenue. Amortization expense increased slightly, mainly due to acquisitions.Now when I look at my segment operating income for Transit, operating income increased 28% to $61 million, for an operating margin of about 9%. This includes $2.3 million for restructuring expenses and the Indian tax law change mentioned above. Excluding those items, the margin was 9.2%. We expect the margin to improve in the fourth quarter, as we complete some of the UK projects and to continue with our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives.",
                 'WBA': "I would now like to turn the call over to Gerald Gradwell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Gerald GradwellGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our 2018 third quarter earnings call. As usual, I'm here today with Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance and Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President of Walgreens. And this quarter, for the first time, we would like to welcome James Kehoe, our Global Chief Financial Officer, who joined us at the beginning of the month.Before I hand you over to Stefano to make some opening comments, I will take you through the legal safe harbor and cautionary declarations. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements that are based on our current market, competitive and regulatory expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially.Except to the extent required by the law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Please see our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q for discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.In today's presentation, we will use certain non-GAAP financial measures. We refer you to the appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information. You'll find a link to the webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com. After the call, this presentation and webcast will be archived on the website for 12 months.I'll now hand you over to Stefano.Stefano PessinaThank you, Gerald. Hello, everyone. I must start today by welcoming James as our new Global Chief Financial Officer, a role for which he is perfectly qualified, and say how much I am looking forward to working with him. I would also like to thank George Fairweather, who is here with us today. Despite stepping down as CFO, he will remain with us working, albeit fewer hours, on business and corporate development projects.George has made a huge contribution to the Company over now 16 years, and it has been a pleasure to work closely with him through many great adventures and challenges. George has worked tirelessly for the Company and has delivered true value for shareholders. It is characteristic of George that when he wished to stand down as the CFO, he brought his usual diligence to helping find an extremely well-qualified successor and went out of his way to plan an extensive handover. But as I say, George is still very much with us both in body and spirit.And so while I am delighted to welcome James and look forward to his contribution in the coming year, I thank George for his work to date and look forward to his continuing contribution as well after he has been allowed a short vacation. So we are three quarters of the way through the year, and we are here reporting a respectable overall performance. It has been a quarter of continuing hard work toward putting in place the elements of our strategy to grow our presence and maintain our relevance in the valued markets that we serve.We have made solid progress against our strategic goals. It has only been a matter of weeks since we hosted our public webcast Sell-Side Event. So today, I will only cover a few key highlights. We have taken further steps in our work to announce the relevance of our stores here in the U.S. as true community hubs with an attractive range of services and products.As you know, the development of our health care services within our stores is a priority for us, and we are continuing to make good progress, identifying strategic partnership that offer a balance and high-quality range of services to our store. We have announced the ties [ph] with Humana in the Kansas City area to bring full primary care clinics into our stores for the first time to complement the nurse practitioners and urgent care clinics that we have been working with and evaluating to date.Given the profile of Humana's patient population, these new clinics are intended to be heavily focused on supporting those who will benefit most from readily available community-based care and are an excellent fit to our existing services. We are also continuing to look for ways to further enhance our retail offering in store by enhancing and focusing our merchandising and services as well as improving our procurement and customer insights in convenience retailing. Our strategic partnership with FedEx is continuing to grow and strengthen, and we are now rolling it out across the acquired Rite Aid stores.",
                 'DIS': "And I will now turn the call over to your host, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Lowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website.Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and we will then be happy to take your questions.So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to get started.Robert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion of the quarter to Christine and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox acquisition to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services.We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories. The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways that consumers, as well as the creative community find extremely compelling.The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision, in part by allowing a seamless integration of the business's brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value.It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Networks Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets.And as you know, Fox also has a significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world.On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology, as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe. And our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal.Although, the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these DMVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub loss in each of the last four quarters. It's also interesting to note that today more than half of U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services; and on average, they subscribe to three different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind.Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options in the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively.In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace.We've always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC, will make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers.In addition to the recognizable brands and wealth of world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community, as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content.",

Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us this morning. The recurring theme for the first two quarters of 2018 was one of historically strong solid waste more than overcoming a weak recycling market. In the third quarter, we generated strong operating EBITDA growth and we expect that growth to continue and accelerate into the fourth quarter and into 2019. We executed very well on our plans to refine our recycling pricing model and pass on the higher cost of contamination to customers and we saw tangible benefits from the investments we're making in our employees.Our collection and disposal business generated strong organic revenue growth of 6.4% in the quarter. With the exception of last year's fourth quarter which had significant hurricane-related volumes, this quarter was the strongest core price-and-volume quarter in our company's history. And our commercial and industrial volumes continue to show steady growth trends, which we view as clear indicators that the overall economy remains on solid footing.Our operating EBITDA margin was 29% for the third quarter, and our collection and disposal operating margins improved by 40 basis points from the same quarter of prior year. When you combine this with our disciplined cost control on the SG&A line, we delivered solid growth in our income from operations and operating EBITDA, despite $22 million of continued recycling headwinds, about $17 million of unexpected third-party transportation and disposal costs, along with other inflationary cost pressures. We fully expect to pass those cost increases through to our customers with price increases in late Q4 and early Q1.Our current quarter operating EBITDA growth of 3.4% outpaced our second quarter growth of 3.1%, leaving us confident that we will deliver full-year operating EBITDA growth of approximately 5% in 2018.Overall, in the third quarter, we generated EPS of $1.15. Given the outstanding performance in the solid waste business and a lower than anticipated tax rate, we're once again increasing our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance. Our new EPS range is $4.13 to $4.15.With respect to our full-year operating EBITDA guidance, we expect to meet or exceed analysts' current 2018 consensus of $4.204 billion and we're narrowing our range to $4.2 billion to $4.22 billion. Similarly, we expect to meet or exceed analysts' current 2018 free cash flow consensus of $1.95 billion, as we narrow our free cash flow guidance to $1.95 billion to $2 billion for the year.In the first quarter, we talked a lot about investing a significant portion of our tax reform proceeds into our people. We know that our people are the key to our success and that's why we're focused on developing and retaining the best workforce in the industry. We're investing heavily in our employees and identifying future leaders of the company through succession planning and leadership development.",
                 'WAT': "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Bryan BrokmeierThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the Company for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018.We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.In Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. We further caution you that the Company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 23, 2019.During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to the earnings press release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter and fiscal year 2017. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.Now I would like to turn the call over to Waters' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?Christopher O'ConnellThanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.During today's call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in details and provide comments on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.Briefly reviewing our financial highlights, our revenues grew 3% for both third quarter and year-to-date and adjusted earnings per share grew 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. While we continue to make significant progress on our key strategic initiatives, our third quarter sales growth came in below our expectations that we shared with you during the July call.While we continue to see strength in China and had a nice improvement in U.S Pharma, we saw weaker than expected performance in two key areas: our TA Instruments product line and the European Pharma market. Furthermore, the recovery of normalized growth in India is progressing slowly.To give you a bit more color on Q3 soft spots, I will start with TA Instruments. While growth in this product line was 6% year-to-date, TA had a soft sales quarter due to the timing of certain shipments to U.S., European, and Chinese customers. That said, underlying TA order growth in Q3 was encouraging and was in line with the year-to-date order trends despite the slower than expected sales in the quarter.We continue to be excited about the near and long-term prospects of the TA product line, which is in the early innings of a major new product cycle and thermal analysis and is supported by solid economic backdrop.Our European growth was challenged in the quarter by pressure within our pharmaceutical end market. Though we saw an improvement in big Pharma in the U.S during the quarter, spending among top pharma customers in Europe remains tempered with uncertain dynamics heading into the end of 2018.On the positive side, sales to our pharmaceutical customers in the U.S picked up meaningfully during the quarter. We are encouraged with the improved spending that we are seeing by our largest pharma customers in the U.S and our Q4 expectations assume a continuation of that trend. Outside of the U.S., we continue to excel in China with strong mid teens growth. Furthermore, worldwide LC Instrument demand remain stable.Looking briefly at the P&L, we are pleased with the solid earnings results despite the slower than expected top line growth. While investing in future growth through organic innovation, we demonstrated disciplined operating expense management that drove modest margin expansion enabling us to exceed our earnings-per-share target.",
                 'WEC': "Before the conference call begins, I remind you all that statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our 2018 third quarter results.But first, a quick personnel update. As we announced earlier this month, Allen Leverett, who has been on medical leave since suffering a stroke last October, has resigned from active duty with the company. Allen will continue to serve on our Board of Directors, and I'm delighted that Allen will continue to bring his insight and his experience to our deliberations.In light of Allen's decision to resign, our board has elected Kevin Fletcher as the new President of WEC Energy Group. Kevin has more than 40 years of experience in the energy industry, most recently as President of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service, our largest subsidiaries. His main focus will be on the operating and financial performance of our seven customer-facing utilities and he will report directly to me. I have had the privilege of knowing and working with Kevin for the past 25 years. With his experience in engineering, operations, customer service, and economic development, and of course, a strong focus on financial discipline, Kevin will provide great continuity for our organization going forward. For those of you who haven't met Kevin, he will be on hand with us at the EEI meetings in San Francisco and we're both looking forward to seeing you there.And now I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.74 a share. This compared to $0.68 a share for the third quarter last year. Our strong performance was principally driven by three factors: first, higher demand for electricity and natural gas, reflecting a robust economy across the region; warmer-than-normal summer temperatures; and our continued focus on efficiency and cost control throughout our operations. Scott will provide you with more details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a brief look at the economic conditions right here in the heartland.Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been at 3% or lower for the past eight months; that's the longest stretch of near-full employment in state history. The state has also witnessed significant growth in the manufacturing sector in the past year and I believe there are even greater opportunities ahead. For example, in late September, Komatsu Mining announced plans for a new development here in Milwaukee. Komatsu, as many of you know, a global leader in heavy construction and mining equipment, has agreed to develop 43 acres for a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and a new corporate office. Komatsu will invest $300 million in the project, which will have a defining impact on Milwaukee's Harbor District. Site is expected to be eventually housing more than 1,000 workers.And looking just south of Milwaukee, four months have now passed since Foxconn's official groundbreaking for the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park. In that time, a tremendous amount of progress has been made on this $10 billion high-tech manufacturing campus. Every day now brings an average of 400 workers to the site, about 3.5 million cubic yards of soil have been excavated and work has begun on the first building. The wall panels for that building were designed and assembled right here in Wisconsin.And to-date, more than 90% of all the contracts for the Foxconn development have been awarded to Wisconsin-based companies. As some of you may know, Foxconn is also planning to expand its reach in Wisconsin with innovation centers in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Eau Claire and Racine. We're just beginning folks to see the tremendous catalytic effect of Foxconn's investment plans for the region.",
                 'WCG': "I would now like to turn the conference over to Beau Garverick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Beau Garverick - WellCare Health Plans, Inc.Thank you, Nicole, and thank you all for joining us this morning for a discussion of WellCare's 2018 third quarter results. Today, we'll be making forward-looking statements, including but not limited to our 2018 financial guidance and outlook. Various risk and uncertainties, such as those described in our SEC filings, may materially impact those statements. While these risk and uncertainties may cause our future results to differ from today's statements, we are not undertaking any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement.Today, we will be discussing certain financial measures that have been adjusted for expenses that we believe are not indicative of long-term business operations which we will identify. Please refer to our news release published this morning and available on our website at www.wellcare.com for a reconciliation of these financial measures determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to our adjusted measures. Our discussion today will be led by Ken Burdick, WellCare's Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Asher, the company's Chief Financial Officer.I will now turn the discussion over to Ken. Ken?Kenneth A. Burdick - WellCare Health Plans, Inc.Thank you, Beau. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our third quarter results and update our outlook for 2018. I'm pleased to report that our continued focus on improving operationally and financially has yielded strong results. We continued to build upon our momentum with the closing of the Meridian transaction, our pending acquisition of Aetna's Part D business, and continued improvement in our Medicare Star Ratings.We are pleased to report third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.33, and as we announced this morning, an increase in our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.90 to $11, or an increase of $0.15 at the midpoint.This morning, I'll review key items from the quarter and discuss some recent developments that give us confidence we are well positioned for continued success as we move toward the end of this year and into 2019. Then, Drew will review our financial results in more detail and provide some commentary on our revised 2018 guidance.First, let's begin with Meridian. We were thrilled to be able to close the transaction effective September 1, only 96 days after signing. Our integration efforts are well underway and are on track. Through these integration activities, we continue to be impressed with the people and systems on which Meridian has been built. The associates are a significant reason for its long-term success. Their relentless focus on quality and the ability to attract a multi-generational workforce are proven strengths which we intend to build upon at WellCare.Further, the systems that Meridian built to operate their health plans and PBM provide real-time data integration and cutting-edge enterprise information management. We look forward to leveraging these and other best practices across the entire WellCare enterprise.In late September, we entered into agreements with Aetna to acquire their standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan business, contingent upon the closing of the CVS Health-Aetna transaction. This is an exciting transaction for WellCare as it will significantly expand our Medicare Part D business, enhance our competitive position in Part D and, over time, help us continue to improve our pharmacy cost structure across all three lines of business: PDP, Medicare and Medicaid.We're delighted that we were able to provide a solution to the Department of Justice as well as our partners at CVS. We look forward to working closely with CVS and Aetna as we execute this transaction and welcome these new members to WellCare.Turning to our financial results, for the third quarter of 2018, we reported total revenue of $5.1 billion, representing an increase of nearly 15% compared with the third quarter of 2017. All three business segments continued to execute well in the quarter and we feel confident that our momentum will continue as we look toward 2019.Our Medicaid Health Plans segment performed well in the quarter, with an adjusted MBR of 87.8%. Additionally, with the closing of the Meridian transaction, WellCare added approximately 1.1 million members, bringing our total Medicaid Health Plans segment membership to 3.9 million at the end of the quarter.As you may recall, in March of this year, we were selected to enter into a contract with the state of Arizona's Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System or AHCCCS to coordinate physical and behavioral services in the Central and North geographic service areas. The services under this new contract began October 1 and we added approximately 50,000 new members. Effective collaboration between our local market leadership and our integration management office contributed to a successful launch of this program.",
                 'WFC': 'John CampbellThank you, Regina. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today’s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan.Tim SloanThank you, John. Good morning. And I want to thank you all for joining us today. We earned $6 billion in the third quarter, which was $1.13 per diluted common share. And we grew revenue and reduced non-interest expense on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. These results reflect the transformational changes that we have been making at Wells Fargo and I want to focus my comments on the progress that we have made on the six goals that the operating committee and I established last year.The first goal I will focus on is risk management. We are working hard to transform how we manage risk at Wells Fargo. And our goal is not only to meet, but exceed regulatory expectations so that we have the best risk management in the industry. We are pleased with the expertise our new Chief Risk Officer, Mandy Norton has brought to the process and we continue to make progress. We have had constructive dialogue with our regulators. And we are taking their detailed feedback and making changes across the company, especially in our operational and compliance risk management structure. A key milestone in this process is our newly enhanced risk management framework which fundamentally transforms how we manage risk throughout the organization in a comprehensive, integrated, and consistent manner. In addition, during the third quarter, we successfully completed the requirements of a consent order with the OCC related to compliance with provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Satisfying this consent order is a great example of why effective risk management is not only good for Wells Fargo, but also good for our customers. As part of our goal to provide exceptional customer service and advice, Wells Fargo advisors launched the Envision scenario, which allows our clients to model how changing their investment decisions can impact their investment goals.In addition, our retail customers continue to benefit from consumer-friendly initiatives we implemented last year, including overdraft rewind which has helped over 1.8 million customers avoid overdraft charges. As some of you may have seen, we recently launched a new ad as part of our national advertising campaign highlighting this industry leading feature. Also in the third quarter this year, we eliminated monthly service fees for teen checking and everyday checking for young adults. While this latest change does not have a material impact on our deposit service charges since the monthly fees were minimal, it does encourage younger customers to join and stay with Wells Fargo. The changes we are making are having a positive impact. For example, retention of our primary consumer checking customers reached a 5-year high in the third quarter. We have also continued to introduce industry leading innovations, including using technology to provide our customers more control and transparency. In September, 28% of all retail mortgage applications were done through our online mortgage tool which we introduced in March.We also recently launched Control Tower, which provides customers with a single view of their digital financial footprint, including where their Wells Fargo debit or credit card or account information is connected such as with recurring payments. It also allows customers to quickly turn on or off their Wells Fargo debit and credit card from their mobile device. I’ll also highlight that the response to our newly enhanced Propel credit card has exceeded our expectations. Leadership and corporate citizenship is one of our six goals because we believe Wells Fargo should play a role in building stronger communities. According to a recent survey on corporate giving by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the Wells Fargo Foundation was the number two corporate cash giver in the U.S. We’ve always been a large donor, but earlier this year our Foundation announced it would target $400 million in contributions to communities across the U.S., a 40% increase from a year ago and we are on track to reach that milestone.This latest increase was not part of the ranking from the Chronicle of Philanthropy since that ranking was based on 2017 data. Most recently Wells Fargo announced two separate $1 million donations to support Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael Relief Efforts. We are committed to working with organizations and agencies on the ground to help our communities recover and providing continued assistance to our team members and customers, who have been impacted including reversing certain fees and allocating $3 million to our WE Care Fund, which provides grants to team members who faced a catastrophic disaster or financial hardship resulting from an event beyond their control.We also want to be an industry leader in team member engagement and our efforts to make Wells Fargo a better place to work are reflected in continued low voluntary team member attrition. Third quarter voluntary attrition was stable compared with the second quarter, which was at the lowest level in over five years. Next week we’ll launch a new company-wide team member experience survey, which is being conducted by an outside vendor and is another way we will receive feedback from our team members to make progress towards our goal of being the leader in engagement. As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we are committed to generating high returns and then returning more capital to shareholders.We returned a record $8.9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter, more than double the amount returned a year ago. We’re also committed to evolving our business model to meet our customers’ financial needs in a more streamlined and efficient manner. We are on track with our expense savings initiatives, including a recently established 2020 expense target of $50 billion to $51 billion, which includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses and excludes litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. While there is more work to do, the substantial progress we are making on our goals demonstrates how hard our team is working to transform Wells Fargo. We are addressing past issues, enhancing our focus on our customers, strengthening risk management and controls, simplifying our organization and improving the team member experience.',
                 'WELL': "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.Tim McHughThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's third quarter 2018 results. Today, we will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Shankh Mitra, CIO; Keith Konkoli, SVP Real Estate Services; and John Goodey, CFO.Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that these projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com.And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter.Thomas DeRosaThanks, Tim, and good morning. I am pleased by the financial results and improvement in operating metrics that we report to you this morning. Continued positive NOI growth across all our business segments has given us the confidence to raise our 2018 FFO guidance by $0.03 at the low-end and $0.01 at the high-end or a raise of $0.02 at the midpoint from $3.99 to $4.06 to $4.02 to $4.07 and despite the fact that we raised $232 million in equity in the quarter under our ATM and DRIP programs at a weighted average share price of $66.07.We’ve been talking for a number of quarters about dispositions and restructurings. These initiatives enabled us to delever and improve the quality of our cash flow. In 2018, we have shown our ability to reinvest accretively in assets and operator relationships that are aligned with our well-articulated strategy and will drive earnings growth. Welltower’s value proposition which connects, senior’s housing, post-acute and ambulatory sites of care to dominant, financially strong health systems is being embraced by the broader healthcare delivery sector and truly differentiates us from REIT and other capital sources. A knowledge-based strategy aligned with our proprietary data and analytics capabilities is enabling Welltower to drive hundreds of basis points better relative operating performance from our senior housing assets even in a challenging new supply and labor environment. Shankh will go through our operating performance in greater detail but we are encouraged by our positive results in this part of the cycle. Our strategy has enabled us to attract a next-generation of senior housing operators and assets as we have sold or restructured over 8 billion of non-strategic real estate on misaligned legacy operator relationships in the last 24 months. In a sector that is seeing little capital deployed into long-term real estate assets, Welltower has completed approximately $3 billion of high-quality accretive investments and developments year-to-date and the year is not over. In addition to the $2.2 billion ProMedica joint venture that closed this quarter, today, we announced nearly $0.5 billion of new medical office investments including an expansion of our growing portfolio with the Johns Hopkins Health System and Provident St. Joseph Health. Keith Konkoli will tell you more about these investments.John Goodey will take you through our third quarter results and I hope you will agree that the investments we have made in people, and technology as well as having made tough decisions has best positioned Welltower to drive shareholder value as healthcare delivery transitions to lower cost sites of care that will improve health outcomes, particularly in view of the aging of the population. You will be hearing more about this at our Investor Day to be held at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City on December 4. Now, over to your Shankh.Shankh MitraThank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results and provide additional details on four topics. Number one, SHO results and trends, two, senior housing triple net business, three ATM managed care for medical joint venture and four capital deployed in the Medical Office segment. We remain confident in our ability to execute at this point in the cycle, especially given our unique data science capabilities and are excited about the path towards further value creation which I will detail you for here. In our Q2 call, we told you that we are encouraged y the return of seasonality to our occupancy trends. Our year-over-year occupancy declines went from 200 basis points on Q4 of 2017 to 190 basis points in Q1 of 2018 to 110 basis points last quarter. I am delighted to inform you that gap is only 10 basis points in Q3 and it’s actually up 10 basis points in the month of September. And perhaps more significantly, we have been able to effectively close the occupancy gap by holding the rate growth for overall portfolio as 2.8% driven by major U.S. markets which is up 3.2%. This speaks to the exceptional quality of our real estate and our operating partners. We had a strong summer where we saw seasonal strength not seen over last few moving seasons because of the heightened deliveries had absorbed typical seasonal demand. To provide you some more context Q3 over Q2 sequential occupancy growth of 80 basis points is the best we have seen since Q3 of 2014. This allows year-over-year revenue growth of 2.9% which accelerated for the first time since Q3 of 2014 on a sequential basis. So, clearly, we are encouraged by the trend. Having said that, I would caution you not to draw any conclusion from one quarter of numbers, but focus on longer-term trends. ",

Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled fully our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.In the Q&A part of today's call, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask a question. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.As also a quick reminder, we are also providing a concurrent presentation on this webcast and a copy of the slides and our prepared remarks will be available later today on the IR section of our website, including with our Quarterly Fact Sheet.With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.Stephen D.

After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter results and wrap up with our fourth quarter guidance. We will then take your questions.We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter with revenue of $5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.63. Our operating cash flow reflected solid execution supported by healthy demand for our products, particularly high capacity enterprise drives, which achieved record quarterly revenue.Macroeconomic conditions remained supportive in the quarter with Cloud Computing and Mobility serving as primary demand drivers. The positive third quarter dynamics included continued strong demand for our NAND flash products. Our results in the March quarter demonstrate the power and agility of our platform and a sustained focus on operational execution by our global team.We continue to pursue a long-term value creation strategy underpinned by secular growth in Big Data and Fast Data applications. Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT applications are fueling creation of valuable data at an unprecedented pace.The number of connected devices worldwide is expected to grow from 9 billion today to upwards of 75 billion by 2025. This exponential growth will require robust storage infrastructures and purpose-built solutions that allow users to capture, preserve, access, and transform an ever-increasing diversity of data. The Western Digital platform is strategically positioned to play a key role in supporting these long-term growth trends.Enterprise and hyperscale cloud customers continue to accelerate their CapEx spending to keep pace with the rapid growth in data, and this represents a significant opportunity for our data center storage solutions. In the Mobile market, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities with our comprehensive product portfolio. We expect increasing average capacity in smartphones to be a continued driver of growth for Western Digital.In a moment, Mike will provide some color on our strong ongoing performance in these categories and update you on what we are seeing in terms of long-term exabyte growth. He will also discuss progress towards delivering high capacity enterprise drives based on our innovative MAMR technology.",

Third quarter results were solid driven by continued double-digit revenue growth from our digital westernunion.com business and strong overall profitability with operating margins just under 22%. Consumer money transfer and bill pay constant currency revenue trends were generally consistent with the second quarter, while Business Solutions delivered good improvement and returned to positive growth. Consumer money transfer indicators remain healthy with transactions growing 4% and cross-border principal increasing 6% in the quarter or 7% in constant currency.And our digital business continued its strong run as westernunion.com money transfer revenue grew 19% in the quarter or 20% constant currency. Constant currency money transfer growth was led by Latin American, Caribbean and European regions with continued good performance from our U.S. outbound business, offsetting declines in the Middle East, Asia and U.S. domestic business.The price reductions that we implemented earlier in the year in key Middle East corridors are generating positive results as we started to see transaction improvement in the region. In addition, our operating margins increased substantially compared to the first half of the year as expected and cash flow generation was solid. Overall, we remain on track with our full year financial outlook with a narrowing of our earnings per share ranges and an increase in the adjusted earnings per share outlook.Strategically, we made good progress on several key initiatives, including advancing our digital expansion efforts and adding new cross-border payment opportunities to our global money movement platform. Our digital westernunion.com money transfer services are now available in more than 50 countries and territories including recent launches in Mexico and Malaysia with the capability to send to Asian locations and billions of accounts around the world. We also launched a high-value service in the UK where consumers can now send up to £50,000 to westernunion.com to bank accounts in key receive markets. It's a part of our strategy to penetrate new customer segments in cross-border transfers.In other strategic initiatives, we are very excited about our recent engagement by Amazon to launch a new payment option for their international customers. In this arrangement, we are leveraging our cross-border platform and network to allow shoppers to pay for online purchases in person at our agent locations in select countries for now. This will provide access to online shopping for millions of potential Amazon customers who will be able to shop global and pay local. It was just one example of how we are leveraging our unique global platform in new ways, bringing value to partners through our technology stack, API, settlement engine and compliance infrastructure.Now returning to 2018 results, profitability was strong and consumer transactions growth remained solid. We are also making good progress with the WU Way expanding lean and agile management throughout the company, which is contributing to increase efficiency and to strong margins. And we continued to deliver shareholder-friendly capital allocation as we have returned over $600 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends to the end of the third quarter.",
                 'WRK': " At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.James ArmstrongThank you, Christa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued a press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you're using to view this webcast.With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.I would like to point out that during the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and our 10-Q for the March -- for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.Steve VoorheesThanks, James. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. WestRock delivered excellent financial results in the June quarter. Fundamentals are strong across all of our business. Our containerboard mills are operating at full capacity, and backlogs from the consumer mills are at or near-record levels.Year-over-year performance improved significantly. Sales increased $442 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $163 million or 27%. We generated $783 million of adjusted operating cash flow. This increased 21% from last year. We remain on track to achieve our previously communicated full year goals for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow.In the quarter, we achieved the $1 billion synergy and performance improvements goal that we set at the inception of WestRock just three years ago. When we set this goal, we developed specific targets and plans throughout the company, including for our operating locations and for functions such as procurement and logistics. Our collective focus on the $1 billion goal has been relentless. I'm proud of our team's efforts that enabled us to achieve this milestone one quarter early. And while we celebrate this milestone, we know we have many other opportunities to drive productivity across our company.In addition, when we complete the KapStone acquisition, we'll set our sights on delivering the $200 million of cost synergies and performance improvements that we've previously outlined. We returned over $200 million to our stockholders in the quarter, $110 million through dividends and $101 million through share buybacks, paying less than $60 per share. This brings the total capital return to our stockholders since the creation of WestRock to approximately $2.1 billion.As you no doubt saw last Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real GDP increased 4.1% in the June quarter. This report highlighted that goods grew faster than services. Should this positive trend continue, I believe demand for sustainable paper-based packaging will follow and grow at favorable rates.Sales for the quarter were $4.1 billion. Our consolidated adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 18.4% increased by 220 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.09. This was up 47% over last year. The results of the quarter reflect significant growth in our year-over-year financial performance and the compelling momentum that we've had in our business.You may have seen KapStone's press release and 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30. They posted outstanding results for the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $138 million. This is 38% over the $100 million they earned last year. On a trailing 12 month basis, KapStone's adjusted EBITDA was $509 million, which is higher than the $500 million run rate we stated when we announced the planned acquisition in January.I congratulate the KapStone team for their performance. As we grow and innovate with and for our customers, WestRock has a need for talented people with experience in our business who will help our company grow. I'm looking forward to the addition of the KapStone team to WestRock. The KapStone acquisition is subject to the approval of the KapStone stockholders at a special meeting scheduled for September 6. We continue to work through the regulatory approval processes in the United States, and we expect the acquisition to close by the end of the calendar year.",
                 'WY': "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Beth BaumThank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser’s third quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer and Devin Stockfish, Senior Vice President of Timberlands.I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.Doyle SimonsThank you, Beth and welcome everyone. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $255 million or $0.34 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion.Third quarter results include a $41 million tax benefit related to our previously announced U.S. pension plan contribution. Excluding this special item, we earned $214 million or $0.28 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the company totaled $505 million.Our third quarter results reflect solid operating performance in the face of challenging headwinds, including severe weather and certain Chinese trade policy and unusually volatile markets for lumber and oriented strand board.Our business is adapting changing conditions throughout the quarter and we remain relentlessly focused on the things we can control, improving our relative performance versus the competition and delivering on our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.During the quarter, we demonstrated our discipline commitment to capital allocation, by increasing our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $0.34 per share, repurchasing $290 million of common shares and announcing a series of actions to substantially reduce our pension liabilities.In August, we also announced that I have elected to retire in early 2019 and that Devin Stockfish, currently Senior Vice President of Timberlands has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 01.Adrian Blocker, who leads our Wood Products business will succeed Devin as Senior Vice President of Timberland and Keith O'Rear, who leads our Wood Products sales and marketing organization will become Senior Vice President of Wood Products.As Beth mentioned, Devin is here in the room with us this morning. He will be participating in the Q&A and will make some remarks afterwards to close the call.Right now, let me give some more detail on our business results. I'll start with a few comments regarding the housing market. Significant discussion is occurring regarding the trajectory of the U.S. housing market. The market continues to grow.Total start increased nearly 4% year-over-year in September, despite disruption from Hurricane Florence. On a year-to-date basis, single-family and total starts have risen 6%. Repair and remodeling activity, which drives about 40% of lumber demand, is up 7.5% compared with the year ago.However, recently monthly housing statistics have been volatile and in some cases softer than expected. We see no evidence of a change in underlying demand for housing. Employment and wages continues to rise -- employment and wages continue to rise with unemployment at the lowest level since 1969.Consumer confidence began 2018 about previous session highs and has increased sharply as the year has progressed. Builders reports strong demand at entry-level price points and indexes of builder sentiment remained very positive.However, the rate of housing market growth appears to have moderated slightly, indicating a potential mismatch between demand and available supply. However, mortgage rates remain relatively low on a historical basis, continued increases in home prices and interest rates may be causing buyers at higher price points to recalibrate their expectations if they take affordability into account. We expect will resolve as buyers and builders adjust product in response to the changing market backdrop.For 2018, we anticipate total housing starts will be slightly less than 1.3 million and we expect continued market growth in 2019.Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands charts four to six. Timberlands contributed a $126 million to third quarter earnings and $206 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberland delivered $121 million of third quarter EBITDA, $31 million lower than the second quarter.Average log sales realizations declined, fee harvest volume decreased 2% and row costs were seasonally higher. Unit logging and hauling cost also increased as we do more high elevation harvesting during the summer months.Compared with a year ago quarter however, Western EBITDA increased $10 million due to higher domestic and export log price realizations. Western domestic log markets were highly tensioned throughout the first half of 2018. As we enter the third quarter, strong lumber pricing and fear of another challenging fire season drove many Western mills to build larger than normal log decks to avoid the risk of downtime.",
                 'WHR': "Max Tunnicliff - Whirlpool Corp.Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpool.com.Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call we will be make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations.We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.Thanks, and good morning, everyone. On slide 3 we show our third quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $4.55, as well as ongoing EBIT margin expansion in three of four regions.For second quarter in a row we delivered very strong price and mix in all regions, as we continue to realize the benefits of the price/mix actions we took earlier this year. Additionally, our North America region delivered impressive results, driving strong top and bottom line growth. We expanded ongoing EBIT margins in North American regions despite soft U.S. industry demand and continued cost pressures as we increase our share positions while also delivering very strong price/mix.Operational and external challenges continue to weigh on our European results, but we are encouraged by the sequential progress we made on slowly restoring volume in the third quarter. And today, we are announcing further actions to refocus and improve our Europe performance in 2019, which Jim will discuss later in the call. Additionally, as part of our ongoing initiatives to respond to external factors, including raw material tariff and currency headwinds, we have recently announced new cost base price increases, including our U.S. kitchen and Brazilian major home appliance business. Finally, we have taken multiple actions related to recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the quarter, most notable of voluntary prepayment of a portion of our long-term pension obligation.Turning to slide 4, I will discuss our third quarter results. Excluding currency, we delivered global growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by unit volume growth in North America and Latin America and strong global price/mix. Ongoing EBIT margin was 6.2% as price/mix was more than offset by continued cost inflation and increased marketplace investments related to recent product launches.As mentioned earlier, we made a voluntary contribution of approximately $350 million to lower our long-term pension obligation funding, which impacted our free cash flow year-to-date. We will discuss our guidance in more detail later on the call. Our ability to successfully execute cost-based price increases and drive improved mix across multiple regions while maintaining strong cost discipline, furthers our confidence that we are well positioned to deliver margin expansion and improve free cash flow conversion over the upcoming quarters.Turning to slide 5, we show the drivers of third quarter margin performance. As mentioned earlier, our global price/mix improved sequentially as well as year-over-year and was positive in all four regions. Our previously announced fixed-cost reduction actions continue to progress in line with expectations. During the quarter these benefits were offset by three main drivers. First, with the net cost, we experienced rising freight costs as well as volume deleverage, primarily related to our inventory reduction action. Second, raw material inflation continue to be a significant year-over-year headwind impacting third quarter margin by approximately 175 basis points, while unfavorable currency impacted margins by 50 basis points. Finally, our margin was impacted by additional investments related to product launches, primarily in North America, which Jim will discuss in more detail later in the presentation.Turning to slide 6, we once again demonstrated our commitment to delivering significant price/mix performance. In total, third quarter price/mix improved by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year and we delivered positive price/mix in all regions. On a sequential basis, every year, every region either maintained or improved price/mix, driving quarter-over-quarter improvement of 50 basis points globally. These results demonstrate the success of the initiatives we've implemented over the past several quarters. Finally, we recently announced additional cost-based price increases in multiple regions, including our U.S. kitchen and Brazil businesses, which will become effective during the fourth quarter.",
                 'WMB': "John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.Thanks, Todd. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler; and Chad Zamarin is with us as well.In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliations schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.Great. Well, thank you, John, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We're pleased to review with you a very strong quarter for – third quarter for 2018. We demonstrated continued, predictable and sustainable growth in all of our key financial metrics, and we also think this is a great platform for the more dramatic growth that has just begun.But before we get into presentation, I want to take a moment to officially welcome our new Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, Debbie Cowan to Williams. We're really excited to have such an outstanding leader join us and join our executive officer team. Debbie's an accomplished human resources professional coming to us from Koch Industries. And we're excited to add another great member to our very talented team here at Williams.I'll pause briefly now and point to our cover slide which highlightsbriefly now and point to our cover slide which highlights just a couple of the many exciting construction projects that are going on in the company right now. Honestly, it's kind of hard to pick because we have so many projects going on, but here on the left-hand side is a photo of the 200 MMcf a day Fort Lupton plant III gas processing plant. So, this is the third train at this Fort Lupton site and it's expected to be in service by the end of this year.And the photo on the right is from our Oak Grove complex in Oak Grove West Virginia where you can see the construction of both TXP2 which is well underway now, as well as TXP3 which is in the background there. So, it's an exciting time for Williams now. The robust domestic natural gas demand growth is fueling demand for our fee-based natural gas infrastructure services.Natural gas usage is growing across almost all categories and has proven to be a good companion fuel for renewables, as well as we saw demonstrated this summer. And in fact, this summer was a great example of the kind of demand growth we're seeing as net power generation was up by 4% or about 15,200 gigawatt hours. But natural gas fire generation was up 17,300 gigawatt hours. So, not only did natural gas capture all the growth during the summer period, it also made up for coal and hydro losses as well. So, again, it actually outstripped – got all of the growth and then some in the space and we're continuing to see that big pool.In fact, if you really study the EIA numbers that just come out recently, you'll see that natural gas has been more than holding its own even in the face of large investments in renewables and currently accounts for over 57% of the new generation capacity that's currently in late stage development. So,it's really interesting to see this emerge and see natural gas starting to become base load now as well as following load as renewables come online. And so, a lot of new renewables but actually natural gas is outstripping that growth.So, let me just list the other things we're going to talk about today here real quickly. First off, we'll spend a little time providing perspective on some of the key investor focus areas for Williams. Then, we'll discuss the key drivers behind our financial and operational metrics for the third quarter and year-to-date. And we'll highlight the major project contributions in the third quarter and provide an update on the other key achievements that have happened during the period. And I'll wrap up by revisiting how WMB stacks up as an investment against the broader U.S. market.So, let's move to slide 2, and look at some of those key investor focus areas. First of all, we enjoyed a great quarter with many highlights. But before we get into the details of those results, I want to discuss the strong fundamentals that insulate us from many of the investor concerns in this broader space. And so, on this slide, we thought we quickly hit some of the most frequent investor topics and provide our own current perspective on how we stack up against these areas of concern.So first of all, we do get a lot of questions on our views of Northeast G&P growth. And so, that's our fee-based gathering and processing business in the Northeast. And as we all know, Atlantic Sunrise has opened up new markets for Marcellus producers and that is now driving even more accelerated growth in our Northeast G&P business segment. There's a strong demand pool from pipeline commitments and – sorry, Atlantic Sunrise's startup collapsed the local bases providing much stronger economics from producers in the area.As an example, on the day that Atlantic Sunrise was placed into service, which was October 6, Northeast Leidy gas prices rose from $1.20/Mcf to $2.70 per Mcf. Now, that by – in just one day, wouldn't tell you a whole lot except that gas prices have continued to drift upwards now for the balance of October. So, probably, in my career, that's been the most significant change that we've seen from any major piece of infrastructure changing an entire basin, not just the Leidy gas but also Dominion South and the Tennessee gas price as well.So, where is the Northeast G&P headed? Right now, we're wrapping up our annual budget cycle where we've work closely with producer customers to understand the very specific project needs that they're going to have over the next two years to meet their own business plan. This is a very detailed well-by-well work which, over the last few years, has led us to internal forecasts that have been very accurate. And for example, through September of 2018, we are within 2% of the plan (00:07:07) expectations and that's on over 7 Bcf a day of operated volumes with a number of different drivers going on. And so, that's a plan that was generated about this time last year.",

Thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of 2018 and discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2018. Just as a reminder, as of January 1st, 2018 we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, a detailed description of the impact of ASC 606 will be provided in the Form 10-Q filing and detailed explanations of how the new standard impacted our performance and the presentation of our financial statements has been provided in our earnings release this morning.Our first report the results using the prior accounting standard excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. So based on the prior accounting standard that is without the impact of ASC 606 reported revenue for the third quarter was $1.9 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year third quarter, and up 4% on a constant currency basis, and up 5% on an organic basis. Reported revenue included $23 million of negative currency movement.We experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments for this quarter. Net income was $85 million or up 257% for the third quarter, as compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $368 million or 19.4% of revenue as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $322 million or 17.4% of revenue, representing a 14% increase on an adjusted EBIT dollar basis and 200 basis points of margin improvement.For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were a $1.62. Overall it was an excellent quarter. We grew revenue earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted EBITDA margin performance.Now turning to the results based on ASC 606 or the new accounting standard. Reported revenues for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, net income for the third quarter was $46 million; adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $313 million or 16.8% of revenue. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.33 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1. 32.Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. To provide clearer comparability with prior periods all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be based on the prior accounting standard and reflect revenues on a constant currency basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting for mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items which we consider non core to our operating results.The segment results do include discretionary compensation. For the third quarter, total segment revenues grew 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Human Capital and Benefits or HCB had a solid quarter with 2% constant currency in organic growth as compared to the prior year third quarter. The solid performance extended across all our businesses in this segment. We had the strongest growth in our health and benefits business with revenue increasing by 6% as compared to the prior year third quarter. The growth is primarily a result of our continued momentum outside of North America related to global benefit management appointments, as well as increases in local and regional market share.",
                 'WYNN': "I will now turn the line over to Craig Billings, Chief Financial Officer. Sir you may begin.Craig S. Billings - Wynn Resorts Ltd.Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. On the call today with me in Las Vegas are Matt Maddox; and Maurice Wooden. Also in the line are Ian Coughlan, Ciaran Carruthers, Frederic Luvisutto and Bob DeSalvio. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under Safe Harbor federal securities laws and those statements may or may not come true.I will now turn the call over to Matt Maddox.Matthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.Thanks, Craig, and welcome everyone. Before we get started today talking about the quarter, I want to take a few minutes and just lay out why we are very excited about the future of Wynn Resorts in the next two to three years.First, I'd like to start in Boston. We were there recently. I was there recently. And we have 200 people on staff right now and we're about to hire 4,000 more and open a $2.6 billion integrated resort in the heart of the Boston metroplex in less than eight months. And some of the major issues that we're dealing with as a management team are how are we going to control the crowd and how are we going to control the traffic to make sure that the five-star experience that people expect from Encore Boston Harbor will be delivered. It's a property that's about to open. It will provide step function growth in EBITDA. We're really excited about it and we hope all of you will be able to join us in eight months for the opening of that property.Moving to Macau, first, I'd like to congratulate the government of Macau for how the typhoon was handled this summer. Not only were they very well prepared, but in the aftermath and the cleanup, it was flawless. We as a company, our 13,000 employees and I know the entire community greatly appreciate it. And when we take a look back at what Macau has wanted to accomplish, since 2002, when it brought in the new operators, Wynn was brought in as the innovator, as a progressive company. It's not going to compete with replitecture (02:41) or copying other people, but it's going to be new and interesting, and that's what we've delivered.$7 billion worth of investment there since we've started. We have choreographed dancing fountains in front of both of our hotels. We have a prosperity tree that has been a tourist attraction coming out of the ground with a chandelier falling from the ceiling that everyone in Macau and tourists constantly go to see. And it's one of the most photo-ed opportunities in Macau. And those innovations are part of the DNA of this company. It's why we were chosen and it's what we are going to continue to do.As we talked about this year, we've been working on how are we going to grow in Macau and continue to innovate because we believe it is the best place on the planet to invest in the integrated resort business. We have a seven-acre parcel next to Wynn Palace. It's right by the new Lisboa project and we've been working very hard on what could come next and what we have so far is a 1.5 million square foot facility that we think will be a must-see in Macau.The podium level which we're calling the Crystal Pavilion is a large glass structure that's going to house lots of non-gaming features. In fact, some of the public entertainment attractions will be all around the Crystal Pavilion. We have a 60-foot gongs fire hanging in the center of it with acrobats on cables going up and down lightly playing the gongs. As you traverse through the pavilion, you will run into a theater. And this theater is really going to be the first of its kind. We got the idea from it actually when we were at the Vatican. The Vatican launched a Michelangelo program with a theater. It took an old theater 1,500-feet theater and created an immersive experience with screens on the walls and on the ceiling.So, the audience had a 270-degree experience, including live entertainment on the stage. It's been quite successful. So, we thought if we take that idea and custom build it in this area with a great 600-feet theater and make it fully immersive that that experience will be like no other on the planet. We actually have three shows that we're working on right now and these won't be long 1.5 hours show, they'll be more like 45-minute vignettes playing throughout the day and we think that everybody's going to want to come and experience this immersive theater.",
                 'XEL': "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss earning guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and update you on recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.I'll now turn the call over to Ben.Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.Thank you, Paul and good morning. We're having a great year and I am excited to discuss some of our accomplishments and an improved outlook. So let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.96 per share, that's compared to $0.97 per share last year. Our earnings for the third quarter were consistent with our plans. And with the first three quarters of the year behind us, we're on track to deliver earnings at the high-end of our original earnings guidance range.We have also updated our base capital forecast, which reflects rate base growth of 6.2% rolling forward and using 2018 as a base. We're also confident there are incremental investment opportunities beyond our base capital plan, as we continue our steel for fuel and customer focus strategies. As a result, we are increasing our long-term EPS growth objectives to 5% to 7%. We're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of the EPS growth range over the forecasted time period.Next, let me provide you with an update on some of our accomplishments, with a focus on our leading the clean energy transition and steel for fuel investment strategies. In August, the Colorado Commission approved our Colorado Energy Plan, which will result in the addition of 1,100 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar, and 275 megawatts of battery storage, along with the retirement of 660 megawatts of coal generation. PSCo will own 500 megawatts of new wind generation, acquire 380 megawatts of existing natural gas generation, and invest in new transmission for a total investment of about $1 billion, which is reflected in our updated capital budget.Colorado Energy Plan is projected to provide over $200 million worth of savings for our customers, while reducing emissions by 60% from 2005 levels. Renewables at PSCo will represent 55% of our fuel mix by 2026. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering this remarkable plan to our customers, the State of Colorado, and our investors. I really think it's a model for how the clean energy transition can pragmatically occur in the United States.As part of the Colorado Energy Plan, we also received Commission approval for our EVRAZ contract proposal. This represents a creative economic development effort and allows us to retain our largest customer in Colorado through a unique contract underpinned by the addition of 240 megawatts of third-party solar behind the meter for this customer. EVRAZ was considering moving out of the state, but instead plans to stay in Pueblo and expand its operation. This is great news for all of our customers and the company, but especially Southern Colorado. This is yet another example of how we have worked to have a positive impact on our local communities.We're seeing good progress as we move from the approval to execution stage with our steel for fuel program. We recently completed on time and under budget the construction of our Rush Creek 600 megawatt wind farm in Colorado. So we're well on our way to having approximately 11,500 megawatts of wind on our system by 2021, solidifying our position as the leading renewable generation utility in the United States, while providing significant customer benefit. By 2022, we expect to have 48% of our energy coming from renewables and we'll have reduced carbon emissions by 50% across all of our systems.Steel for fuel helps drive a very robust capital investment plan of $19.3 billion, and I'm confident we have upside potential to that capital forecast. We have a track record of consistently delivering more investment opportunities in the outer years of our forecast period and I believe this forecast will be no different. I also believe we have plenty of attractive capital investment opportunities beyond the forecasted timeframe. There will be multiple phases of steel for fuel and increased opportunities to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure.",

At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.John VisentinGood morning and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. We are progressing on our priorities to optimize our operations for greater simplicity and reenergize our innovation engine while focusing on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns.In the quarter, we delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and a strong cash flow that is enabling us to raise our full year cash flow expectation for 2018.Work remains on all fronts. However, clearly our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort. We were disappointed in the revenue in Q3. We have an action plan to improve revenues that include, among other things, simplifying the organizational structure, improving alignment of compensation and evaluating contracts that are not profitable.We will go through each of the priorities in more detail. But I will start with a closer look at our results. Revenue in the quarter was down 4.7% at constant currency with equipment revenue performing better, down 2.7% while post sales declined 5.2%.Both A4 and A3 equipment revenue grew at a constant currency, up 9% and 1%, respectively, showing the continued momentum from our ConnectKey products. While high-end declined 5%, we did improve from Q2 and we saw good market demand for our new Iridesse printing press.Iridesse hits a sweet spot within the high-end market enabling both better productivity with a single pass technology and differentiation with gold, silver, white and clear dry ink capabilities.Wholesale will take time to improve. We need to build back our machines in field after ceding share from multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch and penetrate further offerings into our customer base.Operating margin of 13.1% in the quarter increased sequentially 120 basis points and 100 basis points year-over-year driven in part by our work to simplify our business, reduce management layers and eliminate resources in areas where capacity or skills were suboptimal.Overall, adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 reflected the work of the team. Operating profit increased as margin expansion, including the impact of higher equity income, more than offset the revenue decline.A higher tax rate and lower gains on asset sales, however, resulted in a year-over-year EPS decline. On a GAAP basis, earnings declines were greater driven by a one-time non-cash Tax Act related true-up.On cash, we delivered 274 million in operating cash flow and 251 million in free cash flow, an increase of 157 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis for both measures. This strength, as highlighted, gives us confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 900 million to 1 billion versus the previous range of 750 million to 950 million.Lastly, we are delivering on our commitment to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through the end of September, we repurchased 284 million in shares and distributed 204 million in dividends, which in the aggregate represents approximately 75% of September year-to-date free cash flow.With the strength of our cash flow and our significant cash balance of over 1 billion along with our continued view that repurchasing our stock provides an attractive ROI, we are increasing our 2018 share repurchase expectations. We now expect to opportunistically repurchase up to $700 million from $500 million. This will put us well above the commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to our shareholders.During the quarter, we launched Project Own It which is focused on simplifying the business to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed, accountability and effectiveness. This will deliver a superior customer experience while setting the company up for growth.In Q3, we identified the actions and work streams while also capturing some early wins. Optimization actions will expand in Q4 as we complete the Own It design phase for initiatives such as establishing more effective shared service incentives, rationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base.And this is where the experience of key hires with expertise in these areas will be instrumental in driving change, leveraging strategies proven out in other enterprises. Establishing effective shared service incentives is one example of an opportunity to improve the way we work to create an agile, frictionless business that delivers enhanced performance for our customers.",
                 'XLNX': "I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.Rick MuschaThank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO and Victor Peng, COO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.Moshe GavrielovThank you, Rick. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining what is my 41st and final Xilinx earnings call. Been a great privilege to have lead Xilinx over the past 10 years. Needless to say I'm extremely proud what the Xilinx team has accomplished. On the business side, we're questionably on the very consistent growth trajectory having just delivered our ninth straight revenue growth quarter while attaining a 30% operating margin target. In addition, we're quite confident that we'll make it 10 in a row potentially exceed our revenue target of $2.5 billion of this fiscal year.On the operations and technology front we've delivered three consecutive generations of technology leadership by developing both world class silicon and highly optimized software capability. This has facilitated the strategic transition from our FPGA roots of the premier All Programmable Company thereby enabling Xilinx to participate in a much broader and deeper way in our customers multi-market solution and expand beyond our traditional market. I'm delighted to have this opportunity to hand over the CEO of reigns at Xilinx to my long-term colleague Victor Peng, a huge contributor to our success over the past 10 years. I'm very confident in the future success Xilinx under this stewardship.This time I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.Lorenzo FloresThank you Moshe and it's been a pleasure to work with you for almost 10 years I've been here particularly to serve with you as the CFO over the past almost two years.Moshe GavrielovThat is great.Lorenzo FloresIt's not but I'm adlibbing. I'll go back to the script now. But we do wish you well. Sales in the December quarter increased for the ninth consecutive quarter to a record of $631 million, up 2% sequentially and up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the ninth months of fiscal year-to-date were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our advanced products which grew 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year to a new record.Gross margin was 71.1% higher than our guidance as product mix was more favorable than expected. Operating expense was $259 million in line with our forecast, we continue to execute to the plan we outlined at our analyst day last May. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.4% sequentially to $189.7 million. Our operating margin hit 30.1% one quarter ahead of schedule. As a result of the enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, we incurred a tax expense of $183.2 million or a rate of 94% in the December quarter. This one-time tax impact was related to the transition tax on accumulative foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities somewhat offset by the reduction in the US Statutory rate.Our net income for Q3 was $11.9 million or $0.05 per share. For comparison purposes if our tax rate had been in the middle of our forecasted range, our EPS would have been $0.67 per share. Now onto the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $185 million. We returned $162 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form $89 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares or $73 million, an average price of $71.34 per share.During the first nine months of the fiscal year we have returned nearly 100% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have said in the past, we continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are still executing on our share repurchase program and have $372 million remaining on that authorization. We expect ending share count in the March quarter to be in the range of $255 million to $260 million diluted shares.",

Decker - Xylem, Inc.Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. Overall, we delivered strong growth in both revenue and earnings in the quarter. The markets we operate in remain robust and our team is leveraging that strength to win more and larger orders. Year-to-date, we've delivered an 8% increase in orders, which sets us up well for continued strong growth. And I continue to be pleased with the price realization that we're achieving. This reflects both the underlying strength in our markets, but also the quality and the breadth of our portfolio. Our ability to deliver even more comprehensive solutions to address our customers' needs has strengthened and we've expanded the value we're bringing to them in meaningful ways.We also continue to deliver on our productivity initiatives, which enabled us to mitigate the inflationary pressures that we've seen throughout the year. I'm very pleased with the discipline that our teams are demonstrating, truly embedding the continuous improvement mindset into our daily work. That, once again, contributed to our margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in the quarter.So let me review a few of the details. In the third quarter, we again delivered strong broad-based orders and revenue growth. As I just mentioned, orders increased 8% in the third quarter, which brings us to four consecutive quarters of high single to double-digit orders growth, a strong indicator of sustained growth ahead. We had strong orders growth across our emerging markets, including a more than 40% increase in India and 10% increase in China. We also saw notable strength in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment, where orders exceeded 30%. It's great to see the momentum building in our Sensus business as well as across the businesses in our new advanced infrastructure analytics platform.In addition, we're continuing to make progress in the area of revenue synergies. With more significant wins finalized during the third quarter, we've now secured about $100 million in revenue synergy wins year-to-date. Our most recent wins include a large metrology project in India, where we were able to leverage the strong relationship that Xylem already had with the customer to open the door to Sensus solutions. Likewise, we were also able to sell a comprehensive Sensus solution to a Xylem combo utility in Latin America. These two wins alone were worth about $70 million.Now, these latest wins will largely not start to materialize into revenue until late 2019 and beyond as our teams work with the customers to develop appropriate implementation plans, but these wins further validate our thesis about utilizing the strength of Xylem's global presence to create new opportunities for all of our new solutions across Sensus and our AIA platform and drive growth. We see further opportunities in our larger international deal pipeline, which we're continuing to develop.Revenue in the quarter grew 8% organically with strength across every end market and region. Revenue in Emerging Markets increased 13% in the quarter with a couple of standout results. Our business in China grew more than 20% in the quarter. There, we continue to see strong investment by utilities to upgrade their facilities to meet new regulatory requirements, particularly those around sewage discharge standards. We also saw strong growth in Latin America, up 20% in the quarter. Our business in this region is smaller relative to our other Emerging Markets, but our team there is building very good momentum with a focus on the most promising opportunities, such as strength in public utilities and mining.",
                 'YUM': "I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Keith Siegner, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.Thanks, Krystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are: Greg Creed, our CEO; David Gibbs, our President and CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Greg and David, we'll open the call to questions.Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands' website, www.yum.com, to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today's call.Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and Special Items. And third, the revenue recognition accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change adjusting the timing of recognition of upfront fees received from and incentive payments made to franchisees, the effects of which have no impact on cash. In addition, it requires the gross-up of revenues and offsetting expenses of advertising funds we consolidate within our income statement.We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.We'd like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! investor events. First, disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the third quarter Form 10-Q filing. Second, fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 07, 2018, with the conference call on the same day. And finally, the Yum! Brands Investor and Analyst Day will be held on Wednesday, December 5, 2018 and will be available via webcast on our website at www.yum.com.Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. System sales growth for the third quarter was 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. This achievement was largely attributable to the tremendous performance at Taco Bell as well as a solid quarter at KFC, delivering 5% and 3% same-store sales growth respectively. As well as strong net new unit growth at each brand. As a result of timing factors, we've outlined all year and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit growth was 2%.Now, I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2018. Consistent with our communications after our second quarter earnings, we anticipate net new unit growth to be at the high end of the 3% to 4% range and same-store sales growth to be at the low end of the 2% to 3% range included in our original 2018 guidance. We are also reiterating our full year core operating profit growth guidance of approximately flat. However, we have a few items to note in the pieces that comprise core operating profit.We now anticipate our underlying base operating profit growth to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously communicated high single-digit range, owing to the reduced contribution from Pizza Hut, particularly in the international business. Offsetting this, we now anticipate the headwinds relating to the timing mismatch between refranchising and associated G&A savings to be slightly below the low end of the previously communicated six-point to seven-point range. Our estimate of a two percentage point to three percentage point headwind related to the recognition accounting standard is unchanged.Before I begin with our key growth drivers, I want to thank and celebrate Roger Eaton for his many years of service. Roger's imprint on Yum! and the KFC brand over the last 20 years is vast. He joined KFC in 1990 and held roles in operations, development and finance across Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. before finally taking over leadership of the global KFC brand in 2014. Everyone who has met Roger knows that he always brings passion and energy enabling world-class operations to his roles, encouraging markets to adopt and share the best ideas. Roger's focus on ensuring excellence in operations, value and food innovation will leave a lasting impact for which we'll be eternally grateful.",
                 'ZBH': 'Cole LannumThank you and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet’s third quarter earnings conference call. I am joined by our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson and our CFO, Dan Florin.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include some forward-looking statements and of course actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Also the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com and we urge you to take a look at those.With that, I will now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?Bryan HansonThanks, Cole and I just want to say thanks again for everyone joining us this morning. Overall, we feel pretty good about Q3. We delivered constant currency revenue of 2.3% and I can tell you pretty much across the board when I talked to our team members. We are all encouraged by the progress we are making in a number of areas and I will get into those in a second.But before I do that with the idea of being fully transparent on the quarter our results actually look a little better than they actually are for a couple reasons. First of all and I think this is probably pretty clear to everyone, we had a pretty easy third quarter comp, which buoyed revenue growth in the quarter obviously and unfortunately that will not continue in the fourth quarter. We have a much more challenging comp in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, we experienced notable timing benefits in the quarter with regard to both tenders and capital sales on the tender front that happened both in Asia-Pacific for us as well as EMEA and on the capital side it was mainly in our S.E.T. business, either way that those buoyed the third quarter results and will come as a result of that with some pressure to the fourth quarter. Good news is we have banked the revenue, which is the most important thing. So even though you are going to move those between quarters, I would much rather have the sale. So as much as we are happy with the third quarter, I believe it’s important to highlight these factors, because I think very importantly, I don’t want my team or you to get too excited that we appear to be at a weighted average market growth for the business.While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we clearly are not declaring victory and until we sustainably deliver that performance, we won’t. And I still firmly believe this should be a 2020 expectation. So, I guess the overall takeaway should be that our recovery timeline remains on track, but we are going to see some atypical quarterly timing and revenue facing here in the back half. So, my net message is on maintaining the sense of cautious optimism as I expressed in the second quarter and feel good that we are progressing in the right areas. So with that, I would like to provide an update on the short-term priorities that we have been concentrating on since I joined the organization.Turning first to quality remediation, what I want to say here is that anytime we think about quality remediation, I want to be clear that the number one priority we have as a business than I personally have is patient safety. So as we think about our process in remediation, we will always have patient safety first and foremost on our mind. If I think about the activities specifically, our ongoing efforts remain on track and we continue to keep the FDA updated on our progress. And as we have stated before at this time, our quality remediation does not restrict our ability to produce or ship products out of our factories and as a result of that would not have an impact on our supply recovery sustainability. And importantly, we also continue to believe that with the work that we have in front of us this will not put us in a position that will materially impact our financial forecast or projections.In the area of supply specifically we are still not exactly where we want to be, but we are making progress and we are going to remain diligent in this area because we want to make sure that our service levels continue to come up, but our progress in this area continues to increase. And as a result of that our comprehensive supply will not be a barrier to accomplishing our 2018 guidance and I think even more importantly our turnaround timeline is higher than ever. Throughout 2019 though what we need to do is to start shift away from our manufacturing folks focusing on just triaging of product supply and begin to focus more diligently on the rigorous approach to reducing costs in our manufacturing facilities, which will eventually lead to margin expansion for the business.On the commercial side of the business we have continued to build momentum. The combination of stronger sales force engagement, this improving supply that I just talked about, the introduction of new products, all of those pieces coming together are giving our sales organization the traction they need and the traction that we need to be able to keep the organization on pace with the recovery. Relative to new product introductions specifically, we are pleased to see the traction our newly released products are getting pretty much across the board with our surgeons. Notably, we are happy with the growth of Persona Partial Knee which is an important space for us and we are seeing very good uptake on the more recently released Persona TM Tibia. By the way we have now surpassed 1,300 cases in our limited launch process and we feel are getting very positive surgeon feedback.',
                 'ZION': "I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.James AbbottThank you, Latif, and good evening everyone on the call. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2018 third quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook over the next four quarters. Additional executives with us today is Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer.Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full release as well as the slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.This earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout our disclosures.A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer section of this call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.With that, I will turn the time now over to Harris Simmons. Harris?Harris SimmonsThank you very much, James and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our 2018 third quarter results. The results of the quarter were strong relative to the year-ago results.Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights. At a high level, perhaps most importantly, we are pleased with the strongly positive operating leverage with noninterest expense nearly flat relative to the prior year while net revenues increased in the mid single-digit range. Much of what we're doing is designed to push the tremendous operating leverage that we've experienced during the past 3.5 years and the future years.Loan growth was relatively healthy in a quarter that can often have a slowness due to seasonal reasons. We are encouraged with our deposit costs exhibiting relatively low increase compared to benchmark rates. More encouraged was further growth in average non-interest bearing deposits, something that’s not easily accomplished when interest rates are rising.Our credit quality profile continues to improve at a rapid rate remarkably trailing 12 month net charge-offs ratio was only 100% to percentage or 1 basis point. Finally, relative to the prior quarter we increased the dollars of capital return to shareholders. While we intend to further reduce the capital ratios to better reflect the risk profile of the company, we still have one of the very strongest capital levels within the regional bank space with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.1%.Before we dig into the numbers, within the famous simplification and streamlining I would also like to know that we completed our merger of the holding company with and into the Bank, reducing organizational complexity and eliminating duplicate regulatory oversight.On Slide 4, you can see the improvement of earnings rising to a dollar four per share from $0.72 per share and year-ago period. Although we don't provide the so-called core EPS figure, we do highlight some items that affected the earnings per-share that we view as episodic, we are not sustainable in the long run which were listed on the slide.Graphically the GAAP result is the darker blue -- are the darker blue bars. While the adjusted result is shown in the light blue bars. Much of the variance is due to continued improvement in credit quality including interest recoveries, expect the net interest margin as well as negative provisions for credit losses. We benefited particularly from the relatively rapid improvement in the quality of loans to the oil and gas sector.We still have some expected benefit left from this [source], but we are nearing the end of that favorable impact. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2018 continued the trend of strong growth by my calculations, if one eliminates the effective interest recoveries, negative provisions for loan losses and a few hold the tax rate constant with the year-ago period. Our EPS growth was in the high teens relative to the third quarter last year.",

Steve, you may begin.Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Juan Ramón Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements, today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.

We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramón.Juan Ramón Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2018, we have been making significant effort to support future growth with investment in the business. We are allocating more resources to critical R&D projects, updating and expanding many of our manufacturing capabilities and investing in key areas such as diagnostics with the recent acquisition of Abaxis. We are making good progress integrating Abaxis. Our sales teams have been cross-trained on Zoetis' and Abaxis' product lines in the U.S. and Canada, and they're already collaborating on customer accounts. Outside of the U.S. we are focused on building a more robust diagnostic testing and using the existing Zoetis infrastructure to expand our diagnostics sales.The initial feedback on the acquisition has been very good. Our field force has been very positive about the potential of this combination and the more comprehensive solutions they can now bring to our veterinary customers. Early customer response has been very encouraging. Our core business and investment strategy has Zoetis well-positioned for the future with a diverse portfolio addressing needs across the continuum of care and a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations.As I mentioned last quarter, we have taken a phased filing (4:38) approach for a new three-way combination parasiticide, and we continue making that progress. The product will be known by the trade name Simparica Trio, and it will combine sarolaner and two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasites such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease.Our Pfizer (5:10) regulatory filings are progressing in the U.S. The safety, efficacy and chemistry manufacturing and control chemical (5:20) sections are under FDA review. In addition, we have submitted the dossier with the European Medicines Agency and subject to regulatory reviews and approval, we would anticipate Simparica Trio coming to market in 2020. We are also progressing well with our monoclonal antibodies program, targeting pain treatment for dogs and cats. This will strengthen our leadership position for pain in dogs and allow us to expand into cats. I will provide further updates as we move through the regulatory process.Our R&D team also continues to enhance our internal portfolio (6:10) with lifecycle innovations and additional (6:14) such as the recent expansion of Cytopoint to cover allergic as well as atopic dermatitis in the U.S. also introducing (6:28) into new geographies and new combinations.Now turning to a few highlights of our third quarter results. Zoetis continued delivering strong revenue growth with 12% operational growth this quarter. Our diverse portfolio remains (6:52), reliable performance with the growth (7:00) across our major species, markets and therapeutic areas. Our companion animal products performed very well in the third quarter based on continued growth in our key dermatology brands, new parasiticides and, for the first time, the addition of Abaxis diagnostic portfolio."})

## 2. Create dataframe for training and test

#### I want to create data set that looks like below. target is 'return', which is 1-day holding period return post announcement. 'transcript' will be fed into an NLP model, and the rest will be regressors. All numerical variables were available before the announcement of earnings trancripts.

date column is not in datetime object. But, I want to obtain 1-day holding period return on stock from the transcript announcement date. This requires timedelta object. Thus, I change date column to be a datetime object


```
price_df.loc[:,'date'] = pd.to_datetime(price_df['date'])
price_df.head()
```

## 3. Implement models

I am going to put every feature and target into pipelines. This will enable me to crossvalidate every component.
For example, ItemSelector defined below will separate financial variables from transcripts. Then, transcripts will be analyzed by an NLP model called latent dirichlet allocation. The financial variables and outcome of the NLP model will be merged via featureunion. This feature union will be regressed by the target variable, return.


```
class ItemSelector(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):

    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key

    def fit(self, x, y=None):
        return self

    def transform(self, data_dict):
        return data_dict[self.key]

```

Below is an example output of the Pipeline for turning actual transcript to latent topics. Rows correspond to distribution per transcript. But the first five sample of preliminary result is not satisfactory to me because distributions are rather homogeneous.


```
word = Pipeline([
                ('selector', ItemSelector(key='transcript')),
                ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
                ('lda',LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=5))
])
pd.DataFrame(word.fit_transform(train), columns=topic_labels).head()
```

In the presentation slide, I incorporated many plots and word graphics. This notebook is created after the slide was made and is meant for summary of what had been done. Currently, I am interested in exploring other models. Thus, I will come back to graphics if I have more freetime !!! Thank you.
